seth fischer , chief executive officer : 
thank you mark . good afternoon and thank you for joining us . on today's call , i will update you on our business strategy evaluation , provide an update on our qsymia commercialization activities , and provide some perspective on the obesity pharmacotherapy market . 
in january , we engaged an advisor to assist us in an evaluation of our business strategy , most importantly , the disposition of the commercialization rights for stendra . in late {num} auxilium / endo notified us of their intention of returning stendra to us effective june {num} {num} we recently announced that we and endo agreed to delay the transition of stendra back to us until august {num} {num} 
we have worked closely with endo and our consultants to understand stendra's commercialization history , the competitive landscape in the erectile dysfunction , or ed , market , how stendra's clinical profile fits into this landscape , and the market potential of stendra when actively promoted . 
we learned that the ed market is promotionally sensitive and when stendra is actively promoted , supported by digital and print advertising , stendra was able to significantly increase its market share . however , when the promotion ends , it quickly loses any gains made . 
in interviews with healthcare providers that treat ed , we learned that stendra's {num}-minute of onset , the high selectivity of stendra resulting in lower side effects , the ability to be taken with food and drink , and stendra's lower pricing uniquely addresses unmet needs among the patients being treated with competitive products . 
we believe that stendra's proven responsiveness to active promotion demonstrates its revenue potential and when commercialized through an efficient sales and marketing program , can deliver significant value to the organization . we are concurrently preparing to commercialize stendra in the u . s . while maintaining discussions to license or sell stendra's u . s . commercialization rights . on september {num} when the u . s . commercial rights are returned to us , we or a third party will assume stendra's promotion activities from auxilium . 
our business strategy review has also outlined the importance of building a diverse company with a pipeline portfolio . as a result , we are exploring opportunities to drive stockholder value through identifying both commercial and development stage products that leverage our know-how and infrastructure . 
2 
we continue to work closely with menarini , our commercial alliance partner in europe , and sanofi , our commercial alliance partner in the middle east , africa and the cis countries , to ensure the supply of avanafil and provide assistance with their clinical , regulatory and commercial efforts . spedra , as avanafil is known in the eu and other parts of the world , is available in europe at retail pharmacies in {num} countries within the menarini territory . menarini has also secured the commercial rights from mitsubishi tanabe for certain parts of asia . 
we are exploring our options to maximize the value of stendra commercial rights to territories we have yet to partner , specifically latin america and india . 
on june {num} {num} we received notice from hetero usa inc . that it has filed an abbreviated new drug application , or anda , with the fda for generic versions of all strengths of stendra tablets . the notice from hetero included a paragraph iv certification with respect to all of the patents listed for stendra in the fda's orange book on the date of the company's receipt of the notice . a paragraph iv certification is a certification by a generic applicant that patents covering the branded product are invalid , unenforceable , and / or will not be infringed by the manufacture , use or sale of the generic product . 
on june {num} th , under provisions of the hatch-waxman act , we filed a patent infringement suit against hetero . with this filing , a stay of approval of up to {num} months will be imposed by the fda on hetero's anda . we intend to vigorously enforce our intellectual property rights , but we cannot predict the outcome of this matter . 
in the second quarter of {num} the u . s . anti-obesity pharmaceutical market grew by 6% when compared to the first quarter of {num} largely fueled by phentermine generics . during this same period , the u . s . branded anti-obesity segment , including qsymia , remained flat . 
on june 3 rd , we launched our upgraded qsymia patient savings offer to bring more new patients into the brand and support their weight loss effort for the long term . in the new program , all new patients are eligible to receive a ${num} benefit at their first prescription of qsymia . it may be used for a {num}-day free trial of the starting dose or ${num} savings for a {num}-day supply of any dose . a subsequent monthly savings of ${num} will continue for an extended savings benefit up to {num} months .

our digital campaign is designed to direct informed consumers to productive qsymia writers . our enhanced web-based strategies continue to deliver clear and compelling communications to potential patients when they are the most motivated to start a weight-loss effort . in the second quarter of {num} the qsymia site has seen a {num}% increase in repeat visitors versus the same period of {num} repeat visitors prove to be highly motivated to initiate qsymia therapy as one in five download the qsymia savings offer in preparation for starting their weight-loss effort after visit to a physician . 
on july {num} th , the united states district court for the district of new jersey issued a claim construction , or markman , ruling governing patent litigation brought by vivus against actavis and teva . the lawsuits were filed in response to andas filed by both actavis and teva . in these applications , actavis and teva seek to market and sell a generic version of the currently approved doses of qsymia capsules prior to the expiration of u . s . patents listed in the fda's orange book . there are {num} vivus patents asserted in the litigation , the last of which expires in {num} vivus filed the lawsuits on the basis that actavis' and teva's proposed generic products infringe the vivus patents . in the ruling , the courts adopted vivus' proposed constructions for all but one of the disputed claim terms and adopted a compromise construction that was acceptable to vivus for the final claim term . the next phase of the ongoing litigation with actavis will be expert discovery . the teva case remains in fact discovery . no trial date has been scheduled in either case . 
as we have discussed in the past , we have a post-marketing requirement for qsymia to perform a cardiovascular outcome trial , or cvot . to date , there have been no indications throughout the qsymia clinical development program nor post-marketing experience of any increase in adverse cardiovascular events . given this historical information , along with the established safety profiles of phentermine and topiramate , we continue to believe that qsymia poses no true cardiovascular safety risk . 
representatives from vivus met with fda in may {num} to discuss alternative strategies for obtaining cv outcomes data that would be substantially more feasible , and ensure timely collection of data to better inform on the cv safety of qsymia . as a part of addressing the fda comments from this meeting , we are now working with cardiovascular and epidemiology experts in exploring alternate solutions to demonstrate the long-term cardiovascular safety of qsymia . this current effort is focused on the conduct of a retrospective observational study to evaluate cv outcomes associated with qsymia , phentermine and topiramate . although we and consulted experts believe there is no overt signal for cv risk to justify the cvot , vivus is committed to working with fda to reach a resolution . there is no assurance , however , that fda will accept any measures short of those specified in the cvot to satisfy this requirement . as for the eu , even if fda were to accept alternatives to a traditional cvot , there would be no assurance that ema would accept the same .

i will now turn the call back to mark to discuss our financial results for the quarter ended june {num} {num} i also refer you to the financial results and recent business updates included in our press release issued earlier today and our quarterly report on form {num}-q filed earlier today . 
mark oki , chief financial officer : 
thank you seth . total revenue was ${num} million in the second quarter of {num} compared to ${num} million in the second quarter of {num} 
qsymia net product revenue was ${num} million and ${num} million for the second quarters of {num} and {num} respectively . these amounts represent approximately {num} and {num} prescriptions for the second quarters of {num} and {num} respectively , of which approximately {num}% and {num}% represent either a free or discounted offer , respectively . net revenue per prescription , excluding free trial offers , was approximately ${num} and ${num} for the second quarters of {num} and {num} respectively . 
as a reminder , we record revenue for sales of qsymia on a sell-through model , whereby revenue is recognized when a prescription is dispensed to a patient . as of june {num} {num} our deferred revenue related to gross sales of qsymia was ${num} million , which represents product shipped to the wholesalers but not yet dispensed to patients . 
avanafil supply revenue was nil and ${num} million for the second quarters of {num} and {num} respectively . the variations in supply revenue are a result of the timing of orders placed by our partners and may or may not reflect end user demand for stendra and spedra . avanafil currently has a {num}-month expiration date . 
royalty revenue earned on our partners' net sales of avanafil was approximately ${num} million and ${num} million in the second quarters of {num} and {num} respectively . as seth mentioned previously , u . s . and canadian stendra commercial rights will return to us on september {num} {num} as a result , we will not receive royalty revenue from the u . s . for stendra moving forward without entering into a new licensing agreement . 
5 
total cost of goods sold was ${num} million and ${num} million for the second quarters of {num} and {num} respectively . gross margin percentages ( as a percentage of net qsymia product revenue and net avanafil supply revenue ) were {num}% and {num}% for the second quarters of {num} and {num} the change in gross margin percentages were primarily due to the sales mix between qsymia and avanafil during the periods . 
total research and development expense was ${num} million and ${num} million for the second quarters of {num} and {num} respectively . the variance was primarily due to the timing of clinical projects to support our qsymia post-marketing requirements . during the second quarter of {num} we focused our efforts on the development and feasibility assessment of our qsymia retrospective cohort study , the qsymia adolescent pharmacokinetic / pharmacodynamics study , and the protocol development of our qsymia adolescent efficacy and safety study . 
total selling and marketing expense was ${num} million and ${num} million for the second quarters of {num} and {num} respectively . the decrease in {num} was due primarily to the realignment of our sales force , refinement of our marketing and promotional programs , and cost control initiatives implemented in {num} 
general and administrative expense was ${num} million and ${num} million for the second quarters of {num} and {num} respectively . the increase was primarily due to higher qsymia litigation expenses . 
cash , cash equivalents and available-for-sale securities totaled ${num} million at june {num} {num} as compared to ${num} million at december {num} {num} the decrease was due primarily to cash used in operating activities and debt service requirements . 
i will now turn the call to seth for closing comments . 
seth fischer , chief executive officer : 
thank you , mark . 
we at vivus remain confident in our two approved products . stendra's {num}-minute onset of action , high selectivity resulting in lower side effects , ability to be taken with food and drink , and stendra's lower pricing uniquely addresses unmet needs of ed patients . 
6 
we are equally prepared to commercialize stendra ourselves , utilizing our existing infrastructure or licensing the rights to a third party , whichever provides the greatest benefits to patients , healthcare providers and our stockholders . 
obesity continues to be a healthcare epidemic in the u . s . and around the world . qsymia provides patients and their healthcare providers with a proven first line once-a-day therapeutic option . obese patients using the standard dose of qsymia along with diet and exercise on average lose {num}% of their body weight , {num} pounds and four inches off their waist . in the june {num} {num} edition of jama , an article was published evaluating the efficacy and safety profiles of five currently marketed anti-obesity medications using a systematic review and meta-analysis . the study concluded that qsymia was one of two therapies within the entire therapeutic class that was associated with the highest odds of achieving at least 5% weight loss . the publication again underscores qsymia's strong efficacy and safety profile . 
the areas of focus for vivus for the second half of {num} are to : ensure a smooth transition of stendra from endo ; if we choose to self-commercialize , to integrate stendra into our current commercial infrastructure in an efficient and effective manner ; maximize the value of the avanafil commercialization rights for canada , latin america and india ; manage our avanafil alliances with menarini and sanofi to help ensure the commercial success of this important erectile dysfunction medication around the world ; continue to compete effectively in the anti-obesity market by highlighting the benefits of qsymia for this population ; advance our efforts to address in a cost-effective manner the remaining qsymia regulatory post-marketing requirements ; evaluate potential in-licensing opportunities to build our portfolio of products and product candidates ; and effectively manage our cost structure . 
we are now happy to take your questions . 
question and answer session 
operator : 
( instructions ) . our first question comes from the line of jessica fye with jp morgan . your line is now open 
7 
ryan on for jessica fye — jp morgan : 
hey guys , this is ryan on for jess . appreciate you taking the question . i guess given that we are approaching the transition date for stendra , can you talk a little bit more about — are you preparing the sale , your sales force to train to market the drug yourself , or how do we think about sort of the timelines for self-commercialization versus waiting for securing a partnership? 
seth fischer , chief executive officer : 
we are moving down the path to commercialize the product on our own , but also running down a parallel path as part of a strategic process to look at bringing on a potential out-license partner , and those are both actually running parallel , so we are in fact training our own people along with running the other process . 
ryan in for jessica fye — jp morgan : 
ok , and can you give us any updates about the communication timelines for discussing with the fda sort of the design for the cvot study? 
seth fischer , chief executive officer : 
so the discussions with fda are actually ongoing , so they're not necessarily face-to-face . there's been correspondences going both ways between us and fda over the last several months , and when we believe that there's something to further update the market on , we will definitely do that . 
ryan in for jessica fye — jp morgan : 
ok , thank you very much . 
operator : 
thank you and i'm not showing any further questions at this time . i would now like to hand the call back to mr . seth fischer , chief executive officer , for closing remarks .
