use of non-gaap financial measures 
to provide investors with additional information regarding our financial results , this press release includes references to ebitda , adjusted ebitda , adjusted net income ( loss ) , and gross margin , all of which are non-gaap financial measures . for a reconciliation of these non-gaap financial measures to the most directly comparable financial measures calculated in accordance with gaap , see the tables provided in this press release . 
a " non-gaap financial measure " is generally defined as a numerical measure of a company's historical or future performance that excludes or includes amounts , or is subject to adjustments , so as to be different from the most directly comparable measure calculated and presented in accordance with gaap . our management believes that these non-gaap financial measures , when considered together with the gaap financial measures , provide information that is useful to investors in understanding period-over-period operating results separate and apart from items that may , or could , have a disproportionately positive or negative impact on results in any particular period . our management also believes that these non-gaap financial measures enhance the ability of investors to analyze our underlying business operations and understand our performance . in addition , our management may utilize these non-gaap financial measures as guides in forecasting , budgeting , and planning . non-gaap financial measures should be considered in addition to , and not as a substitute for , or superior to , financial measures presented in accordance with gaap . 
we calculate ebitda by adjusting net income ( loss ) to exclude net interest expense , income tax expense or benefit , depreciation , and amortization . similarly , we calculate adjusted ebitda by adjusting net income ( loss ) to exclude net interest expense , income tax expense or benefit depreciation , amortization , and the change in the fair value of the warrants issued in connection with our private placement in june {num} 
the fair value of the warrants issued in connection with our private placement in {num} is re-measured each reporting period until the warrants are exercised or expire . each reporting period , the change in the fair value of these warrants is either recognized as non-cash expense or non-cash income . the change in the fair value of the warrants has a significant correlation to the change in the market value of our common stock for the period being reported and is not impacted by our actual operations during such period . we believe that by excluding the change in the fair value of these warrants enhances the ability of investors to analyze our underlying business operations and understand our performance . 
we calculate gross margin by deducting the cost of sales from operating revenue . cost of sales includes manufacturing direct and indirect labor , materials , services , fixed costs for rent , utilities and depreciation , and variable overhead . gross margin should not be considered an alternative to operating income or net income , which is determined in accordance with gaap . we believe that gross margin , although a non-gaap financial measure , is useful and meaningful to investors as a basis for making investment decisions . it provides investors with information that demonstrates cost structure and provides funds for our total costs and expenses . we use gross margin in measuring the performance of our business and have historically analyzed and reported gross margin information publicly . other companies may calculate gross margin in a different manner .
