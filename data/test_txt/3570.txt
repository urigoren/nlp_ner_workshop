other events . in the event that borrower ( or any subsidiary ) shall take any action to which the provisions hereof are not strictly applicable , or , if applicable , would not operate to protect lender from dilution or if any event occurs of the type contemplated by the provisions of this section 7 but not expressly provided for by such provisions ( including , without limitation , the granting of stock appreciation rights , phantom stock rights or other rights with equity features ) , then borrower's board of directors shall in good faith determine and implement an appropriate adjustment in the conversion price so as to protect the rights of lender , provided that no such adjustment pursuant to this section {num} will increase the conversion price as otherwise determined pursuant to this section {num} provided further that if lender does not accept such adjustments as appropriately protecting its interests hereunder against such dilution , then borrower's board of directors and lender shall agree , in good faith , upon an independent investment bank of nationally recognized standing to make such appropriate adjustments , whose determination shall be final and binding and whose fees and expenses shall be borne by borrower . 
method of conversion share delivery . on or before the close of business on the third ( 3 rd ) trading day following the date of delivery of a conversion notice ( the " delivery date " ) , borrower shall , provided it is dwac eligible at such time , deliver or cause its transfer agent to deliver the applicable conversion shares electronically via dwac to the account designated by lender in the applicable conversion notice . if borrower is not dwac eligible , it shall deliver to lender or its broker ( as designated in the conversion notice ) , via reputable overnight courier , a certificate representing the number of shares of common stock equal to the number of conversion shares to which lender shall be entitled , registered in the name of lender or its designee . for the avoidance of doubt , borrower has not met its obligation to deliver conversion shares by the delivery date unless lender or its broker , as applicable , has actually received the certificate representing the applicable conversion shares no later than the close of business on the relevant delivery date pursuant to the terms set forth above . moreover , and notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein or in any other exchange document , in the event borrower or its transfer agent refuses to deliver any conversion shares to lender on grounds that such issuance is in violation of rule {num} under the securities act of {num} as amended ( " rule {num} " ) , borrower shall deliver or cause its transfer agent to deliver the applicable conversion shares to lender with a restricted securities legend , but otherwise in accordance with the provisions of this section {num} in conjunction therewith , borrower will also deliver to lender a written opinion from its counsel or its transfer agent's counsel opining as to why the issuance of the applicable conversion shares violates rule {num} 
conversion delays . if borrower fails to deliver conversion shares in accordance with the timeframe stated in section {num} lender , at any time prior to selling all of those conversion shares , may rescind in whole or in part that particular conversion attributable to the unsold conversion shares , with a corresponding increase to the outstanding balance ( any returned amount will tack back to the original issue date for purposes of determining the holding period under rule {num} in addition , for each conversion , in the event that conversion shares are not delivered by the fourth trading day ( inclusive of the day of the conversion ) , a late fee equal to the greater of ( a ) ${num} and ( b ) 2% of the applicable conversion share value rounded to the nearest multiple of ${num} ( but in any event the cumulative amount of such late fees for each conversion shall not exceed {num}% of the applicable conversion share value ) will be assessed for each day after the third trading day ( inclusive of the day of the conversion ) until conversion share delivery is made ; and such late fee will be added to the outstanding balance ( such fees , the " conversion delay late fees " ) . for illustration purposes only , if lender delivers a conversion notice to borrower pursuant to which borrower is required to deliver {num} conversion shares to lender and on the delivery date such conversion shares have a conversion share value of ${num} ( assuming a closing trade price on the delivery date of ${num} per share of common stock ) , then in such event a conversion delay late fee in the amount of ${num} per day ( the greater of ${num} per day and ${num} multiplied by 2% , which is ${num} ) would be added to the outstanding balance of the note until such conversion shares are delivered to lender . for purposes of this example , if the conversion shares are delivered to lender twenty ( {num} ) days after the applicable delivery date , the total conversion delay late fees that would be added to the outstanding balance would be ${num} ( {num} days multiplied by ${num} per day ) . if the conversion shares are delivered to lender one hundred ( {num} ) days after the applicable delivery date , the total conversion delay late fees that would be added to the outstanding balance would be ${num} ( {num} days multiplied by ${num} per day , but capped at {num}% of the conversion share value ) . 
ownership limitation . notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this note or the other exchange documents , if at any time lender shall or would be issued shares of common stock under any of the exchange documents , but such issuance would cause lender ( together with its affiliates ) to beneficially own a number of shares exceeding {num}% of the number of shares of common stock outstanding on such date ( including for such purpose the shares of common stock issuable upon such issuance ) ( the " maximum percentage " ) , then borrower must not issue to lender shares of common stock which would exceed the maximum percentage . for purposes of this section , beneficial ownership of common stock will be determined pursuant to section {num} ( d ) of the {num} act . the shares of common stock issuable to lender that would cause the maximum percentage to be exceeded are referred to herein as the " ownership limitation shares " . borrower will reserve the ownership limitation shares for the exclusive benefit of lender . from time to time , lender may notify borrower in writing of the number of the ownership limitation shares that may be issued to lender without causing lender to exceed the maximum percentage . upon receipt of such notice , borrower shall be unconditionally obligated to immediately issue such designated shares to lender , with a corresponding reduction in the number of the ownership limitation shares . notwithstanding the forgoing , the term " {num}% " above shall be replaced with " {num}% " at such time as the market capitalization is less than ${num} notwithstanding any other provision contained herein , if the term " {num}% " is replaced with " {num}% " pursuant to the preceding sentence , such increase to " {num}% " shall remain at {num}% until increased , decreased or waived by lender as set forth below . by written notice to borrower , lender may increase , decrease or waive the maximum percentage as to itself but any such waiver will not be effective until the {num}st day after delivery thereof . the foregoing {num}-day notice requirement is enforceable , unconditional and non-waivable and shall apply to all affiliates and assigns of lender .

pursuant to the terms of the exchange agreement , until all of company's obligations under the exchange agreement and the notes are paid and performed in full , company has agreed to at all times establish and maintain a reserve of shares of authorized but unissued common stock equal to the amount calculated as follows ( such calculated amount is referred to herein as the " share reserve " ) : three ( 3 ) times the number of shares obtained by dividing the outstanding balance by the conversion price ( as defined in the notes ) . 
this irrevocable letter of instructions ( this " letter " ) shall serve as the authorization and direction of company to direct transfer , llc , or its successors , as company's transfer agent ( hereinafter , " you " or " your " ) , to reserve shares of common stock and to issue ( or where relevant , to reissue in the name of investor ) shares of common stock to investor or its broker , upon conversion of the notes , as follows : 
from and after the date hereof and until all of company's obligations under the exchange agreement and the notes are paid and performed in full , ( a ) you shall establish a reserve of shares of authorized but unissued common stock in an amount not less than {num} shares ( the " transfer agent reserve " ) , ( b ) you shall maintain and hold the transfer agent reserve for the exclusive benefit of investor , ( c ) you shall issue the shares of common stock held in the transfer agent reserve to investor or its broker only ( subject to the immediately following clause ( d ) ) , ( d ) when you issue shares of common stock to investor or its broker under the notes pursuant to the other instructions in this letter , you shall issue such shares from company's authorized and unissued shares of common stock to the extent the same are available and not from the transfer agent reserve unless and until there are no authorized shares of common stock available for issuance other than those held in the transfer agent reserve , at which point , and upon your receipt of written authorization from investor , you shall then issue any shares of common stock deliverable to investor under the notes from the transfer agent reserve , ( e ) you shall not otherwise reduce the transfer agent reserve under any circumstances , unless investor delivers to you written pre-approval of such reduction , and ( f ) you shall immediately add shares of common stock to the transfer agent reserve in increments of {num} shares as and when requested by company or investor in writing from time to time , provided that such incremental increases do not cause the transfer agent reserve to exceed the share reserve . 
you shall issue the shares to investor or its broker in accordance with paragraph 3 upon a conversion of all or any portion of the notes , upon delivery to you of a duly executed conversion notice substantially in the form attached hereto as exhibit a ( a " conversion notice " ) . 
in connection with a conversion notice delivered to you pursuant to paragraph 2 above , you will receive a legal opinion as to the free transferability of the shares , dated within ninety ( {num} ) days from the date of the conversion notice , from either investor's or company's legal counsel , indicating that the shares to be issued are registered pursuant to an effective registration statement under the {num} act , or pursuant to rule {num} promulgated under the {num} act ( " rule {num} " ) , or any other available exemption under the {num} act , the issuance of the applicable shares to investor is exempt from registration under the {num} act , and thus the shares may be issued or delivered without restrictive legend ( the " opinion letter " ) . upon your receipt of a conversion notice and an opinion letter , you shall , within three ( 3 ) trading days ( as defined below ) thereafter , ( i ) if you are eligible to participate in the depository trust company ( " dtc " ) fast automated securities transfer program , and the common stock is eligible to be transferred electronically with dtc through the deposit / withdrawal at custodian system ( " dwac eligible " ) , credit such aggregate number of dwac eligible shares of common stock to investor's or its designee's balance account with dtc , provided investor identifies its bank or broker ( by providing its name and dtc participant number ) and causes its bank or broker to initiate such dwac eligible transaction , or ( ii ) if the common stock is not then dwac eligible , issue and deliver to investor or its broker ( as specified in the applicable conversion notice ) , via reputable overnight courier , to the address specified in the conversion notice , a certificate , registered in the name of investor or its designee , representing such aggregate number of shares of common stock as have been requested by investor to be transferred in the conversion notice . such shares ( a ) shall not bear any legend restricting transfer , ( b ) shall not be subject to any stop-transfer restrictions , and ( c ) shall otherwise be freely transferable on the books and records of company . for purposes hereof , " trading day " shall mean any day on which the new york stock exchange is open for trading .
