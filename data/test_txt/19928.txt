you are urged to consult your tax advisors regarding the tax consequences to you of : 
· 
the acquisition , ownership and sale or other disposition of our securities , including the federal , state , local , foreign and other tax consequences ; 
· 
our election to be taxed as a reit for federal income tax purposes ; and

taxation of our company 
general . we elected to be taxed as a reit under sections {num} through {num} of the code , commencing with our taxable year ended december {num} {num} we believe that we have been organized and have operated in a manner that has allowed us to qualify for taxation as a reit under the code commencing with our taxable year ended december {num} {num} and we intend to continue to be organized and operate in this manner . however , qualification and taxation as a reit depend upon our ability to meet the various qualification tests imposed under the code , including through actual annual operating results , asset composition , distribution levels and diversity of stock ownership . accordingly , no assurance can be given that we have been organized and have operated , or will continue to be organized and operated , in a manner so as to qualify or remain qualified as a reit . see " —failure to qualify . " 
the sections of the code and the corresponding treasury regulations that relate to qualification and operation as a reit are highly technical and complex . the following discussion sets forth certain material aspects of the sections of the code that govern the federal income tax treatment of a reit and its stockholders . this summary is qualified in its entirety by the applicable code provisions , relevant rules and regulations promulgated under the code , and administrative and judicial interpretations thereof . 
latham & watkins llp has acted as our tax counsel in connection with this current report on form 8-k and has rendered an opinion to us , dated as of february {num} {num} ( the date of the prospectus ) , to the effect that , commencing with our taxable year ending december {num} {num} we have been organized and have operated in conformity with the requirements for qualification and taxation as a reit under the code , and our proposed method of operation will enable us to continue to meet the requirements for qualification and taxation as a reit under the code . a copy of this opinion was filed as an exhibit to the registration statement on form s-3 filed with the securities and exchange commission on february {num} {num} of which the prospectus is a part . it must be emphasized that this opinion was based on various assumptions and representations as to factual matters , including representations made by us in a factual certificate provided by one of our officers . in addition , this opinion was based upon our factual representations set forth in the prospectus . moreover , our qualification and taxation as a reit depend upon our ability to meet the various qualification tests imposed under the code , which are discussed below , including through actual annual operating results , asset composition , distribution levels and diversity of stock ownership , the results of which have not been and will not be reviewed by latham & watkins llp . accordingly , no assurance can be given that our actual results of operations for any particular taxable year have satisfied or will satisfy those requirements . further , the anticipated federal income tax treatment described in this discussion may be changed , perhaps retroactively , by legislative , administrative or judicial action at any time . latham & watkins llp has no obligation to update its opinion subsequent to the date of such opinion . 
provided we qualify for taxation as a reit , we generally will not be required to pay federal corporate income taxes on our reit taxable income that is currently distributed to our stockholders . this treatment substantially eliminates the " double taxation " that ordinarily results from investment in a c corporation . a c corporation is a corporation that is generally required to pay tax at the corporate level . double taxation generally means income taxation that occurs once at the corporate-level when income is earned and once again at the stockholder level when the income is distributed . we will , however , be required to pay federal income tax as follows : 
· 
we will be required to pay tax at regular corporate rates on any undistributed reit taxable income , including undistributed net capital gains . 
· 
we may be required to pay the " alternative minimum tax " on our items of tax preference under some circumstances . 
· 
if we have ( 1 ) net income from the sale or other disposition of " foreclosure property " which is held primarily for sale to customers in the ordinary course of business or ( 2 ) other nonqualifying income from foreclosure property , we will be required to pay tax at the highest corporate rate on this income . to the extent that income from foreclosure property is otherwise qualifying income for purposes of the {num}% gross income test , this tax is not applicable . subject to certain other requirements , foreclosure property generally is defined as property we acquired through foreclosure or after a default on a loan secured by the property or a lease of the property . 
· 
we will be required to pay a {num}% tax on any net income from prohibited transactions . prohibited transactions are , in general , sales or other taxable dispositions of property , other than foreclosure property , held primarily for sale to customers in the ordinary course of business . 
2 
· 
if we fail to satisfy the {num}% gross income test or the {num}% gross income test , as discussed below , but have otherwise maintained our qualification as a reit because certain other requirements are met , we will be required to pay a tax equal to ( 1 ) the greater of ( a ) the amount by which we fail to satisfy the {num}% gross income test and ( b ) the amount by we fail to satisfy the {num}% gross income test , multiplied by ( 2 ) a fraction intended to reflect our profitability . 
· 
if we fail to satisfy any of the reit asset tests ( other than a de minimis failure of the 5% or {num}% asset tests ) , as described below , due to reasonable cause and not due to willful neglect , and we nonetheless maintain our reit qualification because of specified cure provisions , we will be required to pay a tax equal to the greater of ${num} or the highest corporate tax rate multiplied by the net income generated by the nonqualifying assets that caused us to fail such test . 
· 
if we fail to satisfy any provision of the code that would result in our failure to qualify as a reit ( other than a violation of the reit gross income tests or certain violations of the asset tests , as described below ) and the violation is due to reasonable cause , and not due to willful neglect , we may retain our reit qualification but we will be required to pay a penalty of ${num} for each such failure . 
· 
we will be required to pay a 4% excise tax to the extent we fail to distribute during each calendar year at least the sum of ( 1 ) {num}% of our reit ordinary income for the year , ( 2 ) {num}% of our reit capital gain net income for the year , and ( 3 ) any undistributed taxable income from prior periods . 
· 
if we acquire any asset from a corporation that is or has been a c corporation in a transaction in which our initial tax basis in the asset is less than the fair market value of the asset , in each case determined as of the date on which we acquired the asset , and we subsequently recognize gain on the disposition of the asset during a specified period beginning on the date on which we acquired the asset , then we generally will be required to pay tax at the highest regular corporate tax rate on this gain to the extent of the excess of ( 1 ) the fair market value of the asset over ( 2 ) our adjusted tax basis in the asset , in each case determined as of the date on which we acquired the asset . the specified period is currently five years , although recently promulgated temporary treasury regulations , which expire on june {num} {num} provide for a ten-year period for assets acquired on or after august {num} {num} the results described in this paragraph with respect to the recognition of gain assume that the c corporation will refrain from making an election to receive different treatment under applicable treasury regulations on its tax return for the year in which we acquire the asset from the c corporation . under applicable treasury regulations , any gain from the sale of property we acquired in an exchange under section {num} ( a like-kind exchange ) or {num} ( an involuntary conversion ) of the code is generally excluded from the application of this built-in gains tax . 
· 
we will be required to pay a {num}% tax on any " redetermined rents , " " redetermined deductions , " " excess interest , " or ( for years beginning after december {num} {num} ) " redetermined trs service income . " see " —penalty tax . " in general , redetermined rents are rents from real property that are overstated as a result of services furnished to any of our tenants by a " taxable reit subsidiary " of ours . redetermined deductions and excess interest generally represent amounts that are deducted by a taxable reit subsidiary of ours for amounts paid to us that are in excess of the amounts that would have been deducted based on arm's-length negotiations . redetermined trs service income generally represents income of a taxable reit subsidiary that is understated as a result of services provided to us or on our behalf . 
· 
we may elect to retain and pay income tax on our net capital gain . in that case , a stockholder would include its proportionate share of our undistributed net capital gain ( to the extent we make a timely designation of such gain to the stockholder ) in its income , would be deemed to have paid the tax that we paid on such gain , and would be allowed a credit for its proportionate share of the tax deemed to have been paid , and an adjustment would be made to increase the basis of the stockholder in our capital stock . 
· 
certain of our subsidiaries are c corporations , the earnings of which will be subject to united states federal corporate income tax . 
· 
we may be required to pay penalties to the irs in certain circumstances , including if we fail to meet recordkeeping requirements intended to monitor our compliance with rules relating to the composition of our stockholders . 
· 
we and our subsidiaries may be subject to a variety of taxes other than united states federal income tax , including payroll taxes and state and local income , property and other taxes on our assets and operations . in addition , other countries may impose taxes on our property , income , or operations within their jurisdictions . to the extent possible , we will structure our activities to minimize our foreign tax liability . however , there can be no assurance that we will be able to eliminate our foreign tax liability or reduce it to a specified level . because we are a reit , we and our stockholders will derive little or no benefit from any foreign tax credits arising from the payment of those taxes .

requirements for qualification as a real estate investment trust . the code defines a " reit " as a corporation , trust or association : 
{enum} 
that is managed by one or more trustees or directors ; 
{enum} 
that issues transferable shares or transferable certificates to evidence its beneficial ownership ; 
{enum} 
that would be taxable as a domestic corporation , but for special code provisions applicable to reits ; 
{enum} 
that is not a financial institution or an insurance company within the meaning of certain provisions of the code ; 
{enum} 
that is beneficially owned by {num} or more persons ; 
{enum} 
not more than {num}% in value of the outstanding stock of which is owned , actually or constructively , by five or fewer individuals , including specified entities , during the last half of each taxable year ; and 
{enum} 
that meets other tests , described below , regarding the nature of its income and assets and the amount of its distributions . 
the code provides that conditions ( 1 ) to ( 4 ) , inclusive , must be met during the entire taxable year and that condition ( 5 ) must be met during at least {num} days of a taxable year of twelve months , or during a proportionate part of a taxable year of less than twelve months . conditions ( 5 ) and ( 6 ) do not apply until after the first taxable year for which an election is made to be taxed as a reit . for purposes of condition ( 6 ) , the term " individual " generally includes a supplemental unemployment compensation benefit plan , a private foundation or a portion of a trust permanently set aside or used exclusively for charitable purposes , but generally does not include a qualified pension plan or profit sharing trust . 
we believe that we have been organized , have operated and have issued sufficient shares of capital stock with sufficient diversity of ownership to allow us to satisfy conditions ( 1 ) through ( 7 ) inclusive , during the relevant time periods . in addition , our charter provides for restrictions regarding ownership and transfer of our shares which are intended to assist us in continuing to satisfy the share ownership requirements described in ( 5 ) and ( 6 ) above . these stock ownership and transfer restrictions are described in " description of common stock—restrictions on ownership " and " description of preferred stock—restrictions on ownership . " these restrictions , however , do not ensure that we have previously satisfied , and may not ensure that we will , in all cases , be able to continue to satisfy , the share ownership requirements described in ( 5 ) and ( 6 ) above . if we fail to satisfy these share ownership requirements , except as provided in the next two sentences , our status as a reit will terminate . if , however , we comply with the rules contained in applicable treasury regulations that require us to ascertain the actual ownership of our shares and we do not know , or would not have known through the exercise of reasonable diligence , that we failed to meet the requirement described in condition ( 6 ) above , we will be treated as having met this requirement . moreover , if our failure to satisfy the share ownership requirements is due to reasonable cause and not willful neglect , we may retain our reit qualification but will be required to pay a penalty of ${num} for each such failure . see the section below entitled " —failure to qualify . " 
in addition , we may not maintain our status as a reit unless our taxable year is the calendar year . we have and will continue to have a calendar taxable year . 
ownership of interests in partnerships , limited liability companies and qualified reit subsidiaries . in the case of a reit that is a partner in a partnership or a member in a limited liability company treated as a partnership for federal income tax purposes , treasury regulations provide that the reit will be deemed to own its proportionate share of the assets of the partnership or limited liability company , as the case may be , based on its interest in partnership capital , subject to special rules relating to the {num}% asset test described below . also , the reit will be deemed to be entitled to its proportionate share of the income of that entity . the assets and gross income of the partnership or limited liability company retain the same character in the hands of the reit for purposes of section {num} of the code , including satisfying the gross income tests and the asset tests . thus , our pro rata share of the assets and items of income of any partnership or limited liability company treated as a partnership or disregarded entity for federal income tax purposes , including such partnership's or limited liability company's share of these items of any partnership or limited liability company treated as a partnership or disregarded entity for federal income tax purposes in which it owns an interest , would be treated as our assets and items of income for purposes of applying the requirements described in this discussion , including the income and asset tests described below . a brief summary of the rules governing the federal income taxation of partnerships and limited liability companies is set forth below in " —tax aspects of the subsidiary partnerships and limited liability companies . " 
we have control of most of the subsidiary partnerships and limited liability companies in which we own an interest , and we intend to continue to operate them in a manner consistent with the requirements for our qualification as a reit . we are a limited partner or non-managing member in some of our partnerships and limited liability companies . if a partnership or limited liability company in which we own an interest takes or expects to take actions that could jeopardize our status as a reit or require us to pay tax , we may be forced to dispose of our interest in such entity . in addition , it is possible that a partnership or limited liability company could take an action which could cause us to fail a reit income or asset test , and that we would not become aware of such action in time to dispose of our interest in the partnership or limited liability company or take other corrective action on a timely basis . in that case , we could fail to qualify as a reit unless we were entitled to relief , as described below . 
4 
we own a number of wholly-owned subsidiaries that we intend to be treated as " qualified reit subsidiaries " under the code . a corporation will qualify as our qualified reit subsidiary if we own {num}% of the corporation's outstanding stock , and if we do not elect with the subsidiary to treat the corporation as a " taxable reit subsidiary , " as described below . a qualified reit subsidiary is not treated as a separate corporation for federal income tax purposes , and all assets , liabilities and items of income , gain , loss , deduction and credit of a qualified reit subsidiary are treated as assets , liabilities and items of income , gain , loss , deduction and credit ( as the case may be ) of the parent reit for all purposes under the code , including all reit qualification tests . thus , in applying the federal income tax requirements described herein , any qualified reit subsidiaries we own are ignored , and all assets , liabilities and items of income , gain , loss , deduction and credit of such corporations are treated as our assets , liabilities and items of income , gain , loss , deduction and credit . a qualified reit subsidiary is not required to pay federal income tax , and our ownership of the stock of a qualified reit subsidiary does not violate the restrictions on ownership of securities , as described below under " —asset tests . " 
ownership of interests in taxable reit subsidiaries . we currently own an interest in a number of taxable reit subsidiaries and may acquire securities in additional taxable reit subsidiaries in the future . a taxable reit subsidiary is a corporation ( or an entity treated as a corporation ) other than a reit in which a reit directly or indirectly holds stock , and that has made a joint election with such reit to be treated as a taxable reit subsidiary . a taxable reit subsidiary also includes any entity treated as a corporation , other than a reit , with respect to which a taxable reit subsidiary owns securities possessing more than {num}% of the total voting power or value of the outstanding securities of such corporation . other than some activities relating to lodging and health care facilities , a taxable reit subsidiary may generally engage in any business , including the provision of customary or non-customary services to tenants of its parent reit . 
a taxable reit subsidiary is subject to federal income tax as a regular c corporation . in addition , a taxable reit subsidiary may be prevented from deducting interest on debt funded directly or indirectly by its parent reit if certain tests regarding the taxable reit subsidiary's debt to equity ratio and interest expense are not satisfied . a reit's ownership of securities of taxable reit subsidiaries will not be subject to the {num}% or 5% asset tests described below , and their operations will be subject to the provisions described above . see " —asset tests . " 
ownership of interests in subsidiary reits . we own an interest in several subsidiaries which have elected to be taxed as reits under sections {num} through {num} of the code . provided each of these subsidiary reits qualifies as a reit , our interest in each subsidiary reit will be treated as a qualifying real estate asset for purposes of the reit asset tests and any dividend income or gains derived by us from each such subsidiary reit will generally be treated as income that qualifies for purposes of the reit income tests . to qualify as a reit , each subsidiary reit must independently satisfy the various reit qualification requirements described in this summary . if a subsidiary reit were to fail to qualify as a reit , and certain relief provisions did not apply , such subsidiary reit would be treated as a taxable c-corporation and its income would be subject to federal income tax . in addition , a failure of a subsidiary reit to qualify as a reit could have an adverse effect on our ability to comply with the reit income and asset tests , and thus could impair our ability to qualify as a reit . 
income tests . we must satisfy two gross income requirements annually to maintain our qualification as a reit . first , in each taxable year , we must derive directly or indirectly at least {num}% of our gross income , excluding gross income from prohibited transactions , certain hedging transactions entered into after july {num} {num} and certain foreign currency gains recognized after july {num} {num} from ( 1 ) investments relating to real property or mortgages on real property , including " rents from real property , " and , in certain circumstances , interest , or ( 2 ) some types of temporary investments . second , in each taxable year , we must derive at least {num}% of our gross income , excluding gross income from prohibited transactions , certain designated hedges of indebtedness , and certain foreign currency gains recognized after july {num} {num} from the real property investments described above , dividends , interest and gain from the sale or disposition of stock or securities , or from any combination of the foregoing . for these purposes , the term " interest " generally does not include any amount received or accrued , directly or indirectly , if the determination of all or some of the amount depends in any way on the income or profits of any person . however , an amount received or accrued generally will not be excluded from the term " interest " solely by reason of being based on a fixed percentage or percentages of receipts or sales . 
rents we receive from a tenant will qualify as " rents from real property " for the purpose of satisfying the gross income requirements for a reit described above only if all of the following conditions are met : 
· 
the amount of rent must not be based in any way on the income or profits of any person . however , an amount we receive or accrue generally will not be excluded from the term " rents from real property " solely because it is based on a fixed percentage or percentages of receipts or sales ; 
· 
we , or an actual or constructive owner of {num}% or more of our capital stock , must not actually or constructively own {num}% or more of the interests in the tenant , or , if the tenant is a corporation , {num}% or more of the voting power or value of all classes of stock of the tenant . rents we receive from such a tenant that is a taxable reit subsidiary of ours , however , will not be excluded from the definition of " rents from real property " as a result of this condition if at least {num}% of the space at the property to which the rents relate is leased to third parties , and the rents paid by the taxable reit subsidiary are substantially comparable to rents paid by our other tenants for comparable space . whether rents paid by a taxable 
5 
reit subsidiary are substantially comparable to rents paid by other tenants is determined at the time the lease with the taxable reit subsidiary is entered into , extended , and modified , if such modification increases the rents due under such lease . notwithstanding the foregoing , however , if a lease with a " controlled taxable reit subsidiary " is modified and such modification results in an increase in the rents payable by such taxable reit subsidiary , any such increase will not qualify as " rents from real property . " for purposes of this rule , a " controlled taxable reit subsidiary " is a taxable reit subsidiary in which we own stock possessing more than {num}% of the voting power or more than {num}% of the total value ; 
· 
rent attributable to personal property , leased in connection with a lease of real property , is not greater than {num}% of the total rent received under the lease . if this requirement is not met , then the portion of the rent attributable to personal property will not qualify as " rents from real property " ; and 
· 
we generally must not operate or manage the property or furnish or render services to our tenants , subject to a 1% de minimis exception and except as provided below . we are permitted , however , to perform directly certain services that are " usually or customarily rendered " in connection with the rental of space for occupancy only and are not otherwise considered " rendered to the occupant " of the property . examples of these permitted services include the provision of light , heat , or other utilities , trash removal and general maintenance of common areas . in addition , we are permitted to employ an independent contractor from whom we derive no revenue to provide customary services , or a taxable reit subsidiary , which may be wholly or partially owned by us , to provide both customary and non-customary services to our tenants without causing the rent we receive from those tenants to fail to qualify as " rents from real property . " any amounts we receive from a taxable reit subsidiary with respect to the taxable reit subsidiary's provision of non-customary services will , however , be nonqualifying income under the {num}% gross income test and , except to the extent received through the payment of dividends , the {num}% gross income test . 
we have received a ruling from the irs providing that the performance of certain types of services provided by us will not cause the rents received with respect to those leases to fail to qualify as rents from real property . in addition , we generally do not intend to take actions we believe will cause us to fail to satisfy the rental conditions described above . however , we may intentionally fail to satisfy some of these conditions to the extent we determine , based on the advice of our tax counsel , that the failure will not jeopardize our tax status as a reit . in addition , with respect to the limitation on the rental of personal property , we have not obtained appraisals of the real property and personal property leased to tenants . accordingly , there can be no assurance that the irs will not disagree with our determination of value of such property . 
from time to time , we may enter into hedging transactions with respect to one or more of our assets or liabilities . the term " hedging transaction , " generally means ( a ) any transaction we enter into in the normal course of our business primarily to manage risk of ( 1 ) interest rate changes or fluctuations with respect to borrowings made or to be made by us to acquire or carry real estate assets , or ( 2 ) for hedging transactions entered into after july {num} {num} currency fluctuations with respect to an item of qualifying income under the {num}% or {num}% gross income test and ( b ) for taxable years beginning after december {num} {num} new transactions entered into to hedge the income or loss from prior hedging transactions , where the property or indebtedness which was the subject of the prior hedging transaction was extinguished or disposed of . our hedging activities may include entering into interest rate swaps , caps , and floors , options to purchase these items , and futures and forward contracts . income from a hedging transaction , including gain from the sale or disposition of such a transaction , that is clearly identified as a hedging transaction as specified in the code will not constitute gross income and thus will be exempt from the {num}% gross income test to the extent such a hedging transaction is entered into on or after january {num} {num} and will not constitute gross income and thus will be exempt from the {num}% gross income test to the extent such hedging transaction is entered into after july {num} {num} income and gain from a hedging transaction , including gain from the sale or disposition of such a transaction , entered into on or prior to july {num} {num} will be treated as nonqualifying income for purposes of the {num}% gross income test . income and gain from a hedging transaction , including gain from the sale or disposition of such a transaction , entered into prior to january {num} {num} will be qualifying income for purposes of the {num}% gross income test . to the extent that we do not properly identify such transactions as hedges , we hedge other risks or we hedge with other types of financial instruments , the income from those transactions is not likely to be treated as qualifying income for purposes of the gross income tests . we intend to structure any hedging transactions in a manner that does not jeopardize our status as a reit . 
we have investments in several entities located outside the united states and in the future expect to invest in additional entities or properties located outside the united states . in addition , from time to time we may acquire additional properties outside of the united states , through a taxable reit subsidiary or otherwise . these acquisitions could cause us to incur foreign currency gains or losses . prior to july {num} {num} the characterization of any such foreign currency gains for purposes of the reit gross income tests was unclear , though the irs had indicated that reits could apply the principles of proposed treasury regulations to determine whether such foreign currency gain constituted qualifying income under the reit income tests . as a result , we anticipate that any foreign currency gains we recognized on or prior to july {num} {num} with respect to rents from any property located outside the united states were qualifying income for purposes of the {num}% and {num}% gross income tests . any foreign currency gains recognized after july {num} {num} to the extent attributable to specified assets or items of qualifying income or gain , however , generally will not constitute gross income for purposes of the {num}% or {num}% gross income tests , and therefore will be exempt from such tests , provided we do not deal in or engage in substantial and regular trading in securities , which we do not presently intend to do . 
6 
to the extent our taxable reit subsidiaries pay dividends , such dividend income will qualify under the {num}% , but not the {num}% , gross income test . 
we will monitor the amount of the dividend and other income from our taxable reit subsidiaries and will take actions intended to keep this income , and any other nonqualifying income , within the limitations of the reit income tests . although we expect these actions will be sufficient to prevent a violation of the reit income tests , we cannot guarantee that such actions will in all cases prevent such a violation . 
if we fail to satisfy one or both of the {num}% or {num}% gross income tests for any taxable year , we may nevertheless qualify as a reit for the year if we are entitled to relief under certain provisions of the code . commencing with our taxable year beginning january {num} {num} we generally may make use of the relief provisions if : 
· 
following our identification of the failure to meet the {num}% or {num}% gross income tests for any taxable year , we file a schedule with the irs setting forth each item of our gross income for purposes of the {num}% or {num}% gross income tests for such taxable year in accordance with treasury regulations to be issued ; and 
· 
our failure to meet these tests was due to reasonable cause and not due to willful neglect . 
it is not possible , however , to state whether in all circumstances we would be entitled to the benefit of these relief provisions . for example , if we fail to satisfy the gross income tests because nonqualifying income that we intentionally accrue or receive exceeds the limits on nonqualifying income , the irs could conclude that our failure to satisfy the tests was not due to reasonable cause or was due to willful neglect . if these relief provisions do not apply to a particular set of circumstances , we will not qualify as a reit . as discussed above in " —general , " even if these relief provisions apply , and we retain our status as a reit , a tax would be imposed with respect to our nonqualifying income . we may not always be able to comply with the gross income tests for reit qualification despite our periodic monitoring of our income . 
prohibited transaction income . any gain that we realize on the sale of property held as inventory or otherwise held primarily for sale to customers in the ordinary course of business will be treated as income from a prohibited transaction that is subject to a {num}% penalty tax , unless certain safe harbor exceptions apply . this prohibited transaction income may also adversely affect our ability to satisfy the gross income tests for qualification as a reit . under existing law , whether property is held as inventory or primarily for sale to customers in the ordinary course of a trade or business is a question of fact that depends on all the facts and circumstances surrounding the particular transaction . we intend to hold our properties for investment with a view to long-term appreciation , to engage in the business of acquiring , developing and owning our properties and to make occasional sales of the properties as are consistent with our investment objectives . we do not intend to enter into any sales that are prohibited transactions . however , the irs may successfully contend that some or all of our sales are prohibited transactions , and we would be required to pay the {num}% penalty tax on the gains resulting from any such sales . 
penalty tax . any redetermined rents , redetermined deductions , excess interest or ( for taxable years beginning after december {num} {num} ) redetermined trs service income we generate will be subject to a {num}% penalty tax . in general , redetermined rents are rents from real property that are overstated as a result of any services furnished to any of our tenants by one of our taxable reit subsidiaries , redetermined deductions and excess interest represent any amounts that are deducted by a taxable reit subsidiary for amounts paid to us that are in excess of the amounts that would have been deducted based on arm's-length negotiations , and redetermined trs service income is income of a taxable reit subsidiary that is understated as a result of services provided to us or on our behalf . rents we receive will not constitute redetermined rents if they qualify for certain safe harbor provisions contained in the code . 
from time to time our taxable reit subsidiaries may provide services to certain of our tenants and pay rent to us . we intend to set any fees paid to our taxable reit subsidiaries for such services , and any rent payable to us by our taxable reit subsidiaries , at arm's-length rates , although the fees paid may not satisfy the safe-harbor provisions described above . these determinations are inherently factual , and the irs has broad discretion to assert that amounts paid between related parties should be reallocated to clearly reflect their respective incomes . if the irs successfully made such an assertion , we would be required to pay a {num}% penalty tax on the excess of an arm's-length fee for tenant services over the amount actually paid . 
asset tests . at the close of each calendar quarter of our taxable year , we must also satisfy four tests relating to the nature of our assets . first , at least {num}% of the value of our total assets must be represented by real estate assets , cash , cash items and government securities . for purposes of this test , the term " real estate assets " generally means real property ( including interests in real property and interests in mortgages on real property ) and shares ( or transferable certificates of beneficial interest ) in other reits , as well as any stock or debt instrument attributable to the investment of the proceeds of a stock offering or a public offering of debt with a term of at least five years , but only for the one-year period beginning on the date the we receive such proceeds . for taxable years beginning after december {num} {num} the term " real estate assets " also includes debt instruments of publicly offered reits , personal property securing a mortgage secured by both real property and personal property if the fair market value of such personal property does not exceed {num}% of the total fair market value of all such property , and personal property leased in connection with a lease of real property for which the rent attributable to personal property is not greater than {num}% of the total rent received under the lease . 
7 
second , not more than {num}% of the value of our total assets may be represented by securities , other than those securities includable in the {num}% asset test . 
third , of the investments included in the {num}% asset class , and except for investments in other reits , and our qualified reit subsidiaries and taxable reit subsidiaries , the value of any one issuer's securities may not exceed 5% of the value of our total assets , and we may not own more than {num}% of the total vote or value of the outstanding securities of any one issuer except , in the case of the {num}% value test , securities satisfying the " straight debt " safe-harbor or securities issued by a partnership that itself would satisfy the {num}% income test if it were a reit . certain types of securities we may own are disregarded as securities solely for purposes of the {num}% value test , including , but not limited to , any loan to an individual or an estate , any obligation to pay rents from real property and any security issued by a reit . in addition , solely for purposes of the {num}% value test , the determination of our interest in the assets of a partnership or limited liability company in which we own an interest is be based on our proportionate interest in any securities issued by the partnership or limited liability company , excluding for this purpose certain securities described in the code . 
fourth , not more than {num}% ( {num}% for taxable years ending on or before december {num} {num} and for taxable years beginning after december {num} {num} ) of the value of our total assets may be represented by the securities of one or more taxable reit subsidiaries . 
we have numerous direct and indirect wholly-owned subsidiaries . as set forth above , the ownership of more than {num}% of the total vote or value of the outstanding securities of any one issuer by a reit is prohibited unless such subsidiary is a taxable reit subsidiary or a reit or , in the case of the {num}% value test , the securities qualify as " straight debt " securities . however , if our subsidiaries are " qualified reit subsidiaries " as defined in the code , those subsidiaries will not be treated as separate corporations for federal income tax purposes . thus , our ownership of stock of a " qualified reit subsidiary " will not cause us to fail the asset tests . 
we hold an interest in a number of taxable reit subsidiaries , and we may acquire securities in additional taxable reit subsidiaries in the future . we believe that the value of the securities of all our taxable reit subsidiaries did not and will not exceed more than {num}% of the aggregate value of our gross assets ( {num}% for taxable years beginning between january {num} {num} and january {num} {num} and for taxable years beginning after december {num} {num} ) . no independent appraisals have been obtained to support these conclusions , and there can be no assurance that the irs will not disagree with our determinations of value of such assets . 
fifth , for taxable years beginning after december {num} {num} not more than {num}% of the value of our total assets may be represented by debt instruments of publicly offered reits to the extent those debt instruments would not be real estate assets but for the inclusion of debt instruments of publicly offered reits in the meaning of real estate assets effective for taxable years beginning after december {num} {num} as described above . 
the asset tests must be satisfied at the close of each calendar quarter of our taxable year in which we acquire securities in the applicable issuer , and also at the close of each calendar quarter in which we increase our ownership of securities of such issuer . after initially meeting the asset tests at the close of any quarter , we will not lose our status as a reit for failure to satisfy the asset tests at the end of a later quarter solely by reason of changes in asset values ( including , for our taxable years beginning on or after january {num} {num} a change caused by changes in the foreign currency exchange rate used to value foreign assets ) . if we fail to satisfy an asset test because we acquire securities or other property during a quarter , we may cure this failure by disposing of sufficient nonqualifying assets or acquiring sufficient qualifying assets within {num} days after the close of that quarter . we believe that we have maintained , and we intend to maintain , adequate records of the value of our assets to ensure compliance with the asset tests . if we fail to cure any noncompliance with the asset tests within the {num} day cure period , we would cease to qualify as a reit unless we are eligible for certain relief provisions discussed below . 
certain relief provisions may be available to us if we discover a failure to satisfy the asset tests described above after the {num} day cure period . under these provisions , we will be deemed to have met the 5% and {num}% asset tests if the value of our nonqualifying assets ( 1 ) does not exceed the lesser of ( a ) 1% of the total value of our assets at the end of the applicable quarter or ( b ) ${num} and ( 2 ) we dispose of the nonqualifying assets or otherwise satisfy such asset tests within ( a ) six months after the last day of the quarter in which the failure to satisfy the asset tests is discovered or ( b ) the period of time prescribed by the irs . for violations of any of the asset tests due to reasonable cause and not due to willful neglect and that are , in the case of the 5% and {num}% asset tests , in excess of the de minimis exception described above , we may avoid disqualification as a reit after the {num} day cure period by taking steps including ( 1 ) the disposition of sufficient nonqualifying assets , or the taking of other actions , which allow us to meet the asset tests within ( a ) six months after the last day of the quarter in which the failure to satisfy the asset tests is discovered or ( b ) the period of time prescribed by the irs and ( 2 ) disclosing certain information to the irs . in such case , we will be required to pay a tax equal to the greater of ( a ) ${num} or ( b ) the highest corporate tax rate multiplied by the net income generated by the nonqualifying assets . 
although we believe we have satisfied the asset tests described above and plan to take steps to ensure that we satisfy such tests for any calendar quarter with respect to which retesting is to occur , there can be no assurance we will always be successful , or will not require a reduction in our overall interest in an issuer ( including in a taxable reit subsidiary ) . if we fail to cure any noncompliance with the asset tests in a timely manner , and the relief provisions described above are not available , we would cease to qualify as a reit . see " — failure to qualify " below . 
8 
annual distribution requirements . to maintain our qualification as a reit , we are required to distribute dividends , other than capital gain dividends , to our stockholders in an amount at least equal to the sum of : 
· 
{num}% of our " reit taxable income " ; and 
· 
{num}% of our after-tax net income , if any , from foreclosure property ; minus 
· 
the excess of the sum of certain items of non-cash income over 5% of our " reit taxable income . " 
for these purposes , our " reit taxable income " is computed without regard to the dividends paid deduction and our net capital gain . in addition , for purposes of this test , non-cash income means income attributable to leveled stepped rents , original issue discount on purchase money debt , cancellation of indebtedness , and any like-kind exchange that is later determined to be taxable . 
also , our " reit taxable income " will be reduced by any taxes we are required to pay on any gain we recognize from the disposition of any asset we acquired from a corporation which is or has been a c corporation in a transaction in which our basis in the asset is less than the fair market value of the asset , in each case determined at the time we acquired the asset , within a specified period following our acquisition of such asset . see " taxation of the company —general " above . 
we generally must pay , or be treated as paying , the distributions described above in the taxable year to which they relate . at our election , a distribution will be treated as paid in a taxable year if it is declared before we timely file our tax return for such year and paid on or before the first regular dividend payment after such declaration , provided such payment is made during the twelve-month period following the close of such year . these distributions generally are taxable to our stockholders , other than tax-exempt entities , in the year in which paid . this is so even though these distributions relate to the prior year for purposes of the {num}% distribution requirement . in order to be taken into account for purposes of our distribution requirement , except as provided below , the amount distributed must not be preferential—i . e . , every stockholder of the class of stock to which a distribution is made must be treated the same as every other stockholder of that class , and no class of stock may be treated other than according to its dividend rights as a class . the requirement that distributions must not be preferential will not apply to distributions made in our taxable years beginning after december {num} {num} provided we qualify as a " publicly offered reit . " we believe that we are , and expect we will continue to be , a " publicly offered reit . " to the extent that we do not distribute all of our net capital gain , or distribute at least {num}% , but less than {num}% , of our " reit taxable income , " as adjusted , we will be required to pay tax on the undistributed amount at regular corporate tax rates . we believe we have made , and we intend to continue to make , timely distributions sufficient to satisfy these annual distribution requirements and to minimize our corporate tax obligations . 
we expect that our reit taxable income will be less than our cash flow because of depreciation and other non-cash charges included in computing reit taxable income . accordingly , we anticipate that we generally will have sufficient cash or liquid assets to enable us to satisfy the distribution requirements described above . however , from time to time , we may not have sufficient cash or other liquid assets to meet these distribution requirements due to timing differences between the actual receipt of income and actual payment of deductible expenses , and the inclusion of income and deduction of expenses in determining our taxable income . if these timing differences occur , we may be required to borrow funds to pay cash dividends or to pay dividends in the form of taxable stock dividends in order to meet the distribution requirements , while preserving our cash . in addition , we may decide to retain our cash , rather than distribute it , in order to repay debt or for other reasons . 
under certain circumstances , we may be able to rectify an inadvertent failure to meet the {num}% distribution requirement for a year by paying " deficiency dividends " to our stockholders in a later year , which may be included in our deduction for dividends paid for the earlier year . thus , we may be able to avoid being taxed on amounts distributed as deficiency dividends , subject to the 4% excise tax described below . however , we will be required to pay interest to the irs based upon the amount of any deduction claimed for deficiency dividends . while the payment of a deficiency dividend will apply to a prior year for purposes of our reit distribution requirements , it will be treated as an additional distribution to our stockholders in the year such dividend is paid . 
furthermore , we will be required to pay a 4% excise tax to the extent we fail to distribute during each calendar year , or in the case of distributions with declaration and record dates falling in the last three months of the calendar year , by the end of january immediately following such year , at least the sum of {num}% of our reit ordinary income for such year , {num}% of our reit capital gain net income for the year and any undistributed taxable income from prior periods . any ordinary income and net capital gain on which this excise tax is imposed for any year is treated as an amount distributed during that year for purposes of calculating such tax . 
for purposes of the distribution requirements and excise tax described above , distributions declared during the last three months of the taxable year , payable to stockholders of record on a specified date during such period and paid during january of the following year , will be treated as paid by us and received by our stockholders on december {num} of the year in which they are declared . 
like-kind exchanges . we may dispose of properties in transactions intended to qualify as like-kind exchanges under the code . such like-kind exchanges are intended to result in the deferral of gain for federal income tax purposes . the failure of any such transaction to qualify as a like-kind exchange could require us to pay federal income tax , possibly including the {num}% prohibited transaction tax , depending on the facts and circumstances surrounding the particular transaction . 
9 
failure to qualify 
specified cure provisions are available to us in the event that we discover a violation of a provision of the code that would result in our failure to qualify as a reit . except with respect to violations of the reit income tests and asset tests ( for which the cure provisions are described above ) , and provided the violation is due to reasonable cause and not due to willful neglect , these cure provisions generally impose a ${num} penalty for each violation in lieu of a loss of reit status . if we fail qualify for taxation as a reit in any taxable year , and the relief provisions of the code do not apply , we will be required to pay tax , including any applicable alternative minimum tax , on our taxable income at regular corporate tax rates . distributions to our stockholders in any year in which we fail to qualify as a reit will not be deductible by us , and we will not be required to distribute any amounts to our stockholders . as a result , we anticipate that our failure to qualify as a reit would reduce the cash available for distribution by us to our stockholders . in addition , if we fail to qualify as a reit , all distributions to our stockholders will be taxable as regular corporate dividends to the extent of our current and accumulated earnings and profits . in such event , corporate distributees may be eligible for the dividends-received deduction . in addition , non-corporate stockholders , including individuals , may be eligible for the preferential tax rates on any qualified dividend income . unless entitled to relief under specific statutory provisions , we will also be disqualified from taxation as a reit for the four taxable years following the year during which we lost our qualification . it is not possible to state whether in all circumstances we would be entitled to this statutory relief . 
tax aspects of the subsidiary partnerships and limited liability companies 
general . we own , directly or indirectly , interests in various partnerships and limited liability companies which are treated as partnerships or disregarded entities for federal income tax purposes . our ownership interests in such subsidiary partnerships and limited liability companies involve special tax considerations , including the possibility that the irs might challenge the status of one or more of these entities as a partnership ( or disregarded entity ) , as opposed to an association taxable as a corporation for u . s . federal income tax purposes . however , if any such subsidiary partnership or limited liability company in which we own an interest were taxable as a corporation , it would be required to pay an entity-level tax on its income . in this situation , the character of our assets and items of gross income would change and could prevent us from satisfying the reit asset tests and possibly the reit income tests . see " —taxation of our company—asset tests " and " —income tests . " this , in turn , could prevent us from qualifying as a reit . see " —failure to qualify " for a discussion of the effect of our failure to meet these tests for a taxable year . in addition , a change in the tax status of a subsidiary partnership or limited liability company might be treated as a taxable event . if so , we might incur a tax liability without any related cash distributions . we believe each of our subsidiary partnerships and limited liability companies will be classified as partnerships or disregarded entities for federal income tax purposes . 
allocations of income , gain , loss and deduction . a partnership or limited liability company agreement will generally determine the allocation of income and loss among partners or members . these allocations , however , will be disregarded for tax purposes if they do not comply with the provisions of section {num} ( b ) of the code and the treasury regulations thereunder . generally , section {num} ( b ) of the code and the treasury regulations thereunder require that partnership allocations respect the economic arrangement of the partners . if an allocation of partnership income or loss does not comply with the requirements of section {num} ( b ) of the code and the treasury regulations thereunder , the items subject to the allocation will be reallocated in accordance with the partners' or members' interests in the partnership or limited liability company . this reallocation will be determined by taking into account all of the facts and circumstances relating to the economic arrangement of the partners or members with respect to such item . the allocations of taxable income and loss in each of the partnerships and limited liability companies in which we own an interest are intended to comply with the requirements of section {num} ( b ) of the code and the treasury regulations thereunder . 
tax allocations with respect to the properties . under section {num} ( c ) of the code , income , gain , loss and deduction attributable to appreciated or depreciated property that is contributed to a partnership or limited liability company in exchange for an interest in the partnership or limited liability company , must be allocated in a manner so that the contributing partner or member is charged with the unrealized gain or benefits from the unrealized loss associated with the property at the time of the contribution . the amount of the unrealized gain or unrealized loss generally is equal to the difference between the fair market value or book value and the adjusted tax basis of the contributed property at the time of contribution , as adjusted from time to time . these allocations are solely for federal income tax purposes and do not affect the book capital accounts or other economic or legal arrangements among the partners or members . 
some of the partnerships and / or limited liability companies in which we own an interest were formed by way of contributions of appreciated property . the relevant partnership and / or limited liability company agreements require that allocations be made in a manner consistent with section {num} ( c ) of the code . this could cause us to be allocated lower amounts of depreciation deductions for tax purposes than would be allocated to us if the contributed properties were acquired in a cash purchase , and could cause us to be allocated taxable gain upon a sale of the contributed properties in excess of the economic or book income allocated to us as a result of such sale . these adjustments could make it more difficult for us to satisfy the reit distribution requirements . to the extent our depreciation is reduced , or our gain on sale is increased , stockholders may recognize additional dividend income without an increase in distributions . 
{num} 
partnership audit rules . the recently enacted bipartisan budget act of {num} changes the rules applicable to u . s . federal income tax audits of partnerships . under the new rules ( which are generally effective for taxable years beginning after december {num} {num} ) , among other changes and subject to certain exceptions , any audit adjustment to items of income , gain , loss , deduction , or credit of a partnership ( and any partner's distributive share thereof ) is determined , and taxes , interest , or penalties attributable thereto are assessed and collected , at the partnership level . although it is uncertain how these new rules will be implemented , it is possible that they could result in partnerships in which we directly or indirectly invest being required to pay additional taxes , interest and penalties as a result of an audit adjustment , and we , as a direct or indirect partner of these partnerships , could be required to bear the economic burden of those taxes , interest , and penalties even though we , as a reit , may not otherwise have been required to pay additional corporate-level taxes as a result of the related audit adjustment . the changes created by these new rules are sweeping and in many respects dependent on the promulgation of future regulations or other guidance by the u . s . treasury . investors are urged to consult their tax advisors with respect to these changes and their potential impact on their investment in our common stock . 
taxation of holders of our stock 
the following summary describes the principal united states federal income tax consequences relating to the ownership and disposition of our capital stock . 
definition of united states holder . a " united states holder " is a beneficial holder of our capital stock or debt securities who , for federal income tax purposes , is : 
· 
an individual who is a citizen or resident of the united states ; 
· 
a corporation ( or other entity treated as a corporation for united states federal income tax purposes ) created or organized under the laws of the united states , any state thereof or the district of columbia ; 
· 
an estate , the income of which is subject to united states federal income taxation regardless of its source ; or 
· 
a trust that ( 1 ) is subject to the primary supervision of a united states court and the control of one or more united states persons or ( 2 ) has a valid election in place to be treated as a united states person . 
a " non-united states holder " is a beneficial holder that is neither a " united states holder " nor a partnership or other entity treated as a partnership for united states federal income tax purposes . 
if a partnership or other entity treated as a partnership for united states federal income tax purposes holds shares of our capital stock , the tax treatment of a partner generally will depend on the status of the partner and on the activities of the partnership . partners of partnerships holding shares of our common stock are encouraged to consult their tax advisors . 
united states holders of our stock 
if you are a " united states holder , " as defined above , this section applies to you . otherwise , the next section , " non-united states holders of our stock , " applies to you . 
taxation of taxable united states holders generally 
distributions generally . distributions out of our current or accumulated earnings and profits will be treated as dividends and , other than with respect to capital gain dividends and certain amounts which have previously been subject to corporate level taxation , as discussed below , will be taxable to our taxable united states holders as ordinary income when actually or constructively received . see " —tax rates " below . as long as we qualify as a reit , these distributions will not be eligible for the dividends-received deduction in the case of united states holders that are corporations or , except to the extent provided in " —tax rates " below , the preferential rates on qualified dividend income applicable to non-united states holders , including individuals . for purposes of determining whether distributions to holders of our capital stock are out of our current or accumulated earnings and profits , our earnings and profits will be allocated first to distributions on our outstanding preferred stock , if any , and then to distributions on our outstanding common stock . 
to the extent that we make distributions on our capital stock in excess of our current and accumulated earnings and profits allocable to such stock , these distributions will be treated first as a tax-free return of capital to a united states holder . this treatment will reduce the united states holder's adjusted tax basis in such shares of our capital stock by the amount of the distribution , but not below zero . distributions in excess of our current and accumulated earnings and profits and in excess of a united states holder's adjusted tax basis in its shares will be taxable as capital gain . such gain will be taxable as long-term capital gain if the shares have been held for more than one year . dividends we declare in october , november , or december of any year and which are payable to a stockholder of record on a specified date in any of these months will be treated as both paid by us and received by the stockholder on december {num} of that year , provided we actually pay the dividend on or before january {num} of the following year . united states holders may not include in their own income tax returns any of our net operating losses or capital losses . 
{num} 
united states holders who receive taxable stock dividends , as described above under " taxation of the company—annual distribution requirements , " including dividends partially payable in our capital stock and partially payable in cash , would be required to include the full amount of the dividend ( i . e . , the cash and the stock portion ) as ordinary income ( subject to limited exceptions ) to the extent of our current and accumulated earnings and profits for united states federal income tax purposes , as described above . the amount of any dividend payable in our capital stock generally is equal to the amount of cash that could have been received instead of the capital stock . depending on the circumstances of a united states holder , the tax on the distribution may exceed the amount of the distribution received in cash , in which case such a united states holder would have to pay the tax using cash from other sources . if a united states holder sells the capital stock it receives as a dividend in order to pay this tax and the sales proceeds are less than the amount required to be included in income with respect to the dividend , such united states holder could have a capital loss with respect to the capital stock sale that could not be used to offset such dividend income . a united states holder that receives capital stock pursuant to a distribution generally has a tax basis in such capital stock equal to the amount of cash that could have been received instead of such capital stock as described above , and has a holding period in such capital stock that begins on the day immediately following the payment date for the distribution . 
capital gain dividends . dividends that we properly designate as capital gain dividends will be taxable to our taxable united states holders as a gain from the sale or disposition of a capital asset held for more than one year , to the extent that such gain does not exceed our actual net capital gain for the taxable year and , for taxable years beginning after december {num} {num} may not exceed our dividends paid for the taxable year , including dividends paid the following year that are treated as paid in the current year . united states holders that are corporations may , however , be required to treat up to {num}% of certain capital gain dividends as ordinary income . if we properly designate any portion of a dividend as a capital gain dividend then , except as otherwise required by law , we presently intend to allocate a portion of the total capital gain dividends paid or made available to holders of all classes of our stock for the year to the holders of our common stock and each class of our preferred stock in proportion to the amount that our total dividends , as determined for united states federal income tax purposes , paid or made available to the holders of each such class of stock for the year bears to the total dividends , as determined for united states federal income tax purposes , paid or made available to holders of all classes of our stock for the year . 
retention of net capital gains . we may elect to retain , rather than distribute as a capital gain dividend , all or a portion of our net capital gains . if we make this election , we would pay tax on our retained net capital gains . in addition , to the extent we so elect , our earnings and profits ( determined for united states federal income tax purposes ) would be adjusted accordingly , and a united states holder generally would : 
· 
include its pro rata share of our undistributed net capital gains in computing its long-term capital gains in its return for its taxable year in which the last day of our taxable year falls , subject to certain limitations as to the amount that is includable ; 
· 
be deemed to have paid the capital gains tax imposed on us on the designated amounts included in the united states holder's long-term capital gains ; 
· 
receive a credit or refund for the amount of tax deemed paid by it ; 
· 
increase the adjusted basis of its capital stock by the difference between the amount of includable gains and the tax deemed to have been paid by it ; and 
· 
in the case of a united states holder that is a corporation , appropriately adjust its earnings and profits for the retained capital gains in accordance with treasury regulations to be promulgated by the irs . 
passive activity losses and investment interest limitations . distributions we make and gain arising from the sale or exchange by a united states holder of our shares will not be treated as passive activity income . as a result , united states holders generally will not be able to apply any " passive losses " against this income or gain . a united states holder may elect to treat capital gain dividends , capital gains from the disposition of our stock and income designated as qualified dividend income , described in " —tax rates " below , as investment income for purposes of computing the investment interest limitation , but in such case , the holder will be taxed at ordinary income rates on such amount . other distributions we make , to the extent they do not constitute a return of capital , generally will be treated as investment income for purposes of computing the investment interest limitation . 
dispositions of our capital stock . if a united states holder sells or disposes of shares of our capital stock to a person other than us , it will recognize gain or loss for federal income tax purposes in an amount equal to the difference between the amount of cash and the fair market value of any property received on the sale or other disposition and the holder's adjusted tax basis in the shares . this gain or loss , except as provided below , will be long-term capital gain or loss if the holder has held such stock for more than one year at the time of such sale or disposition . if , however , a united states holder recognizes a loss upon the sale or other disposition of our capital stock that it has held for six months or less , after applying certain holding period rules , the loss recognized will be treated as a long-term capital loss to the extent the united states holder received distributions from us which were required to be treated as long-term capital gains . 
{num} 
redemption or repurchase by us . a redemption or repurchase of shares of our stock will , to the extent of our current and accumulated earnings and profits , be treated under section {num} of the code as a distribution taxable as a dividend at ordinary income rates unless the redemption or repurchase satisfies one of the tests set forth in section {num} ( b ) of the code , in which case it will be treated as a sale or exchange of the redeemed or repurchased shares . the redemption or repurchase will be treated as a sale or exchange if it : 
· 
is " substantially disproportionate " with respect to the united states holder ; 
· 
results in a " complete termination " of the united states holder's stock interest in us ; or 
· 
is " not essentially equivalent to a dividend " with respect to the united states holder , 
all within the meaning of section {num} ( b ) of the code . 
in determining whether any of these tests have been met , shares of capital stock , including common stock and other equity interests in us , considered to be owned by the united states holder by reason of certain constructive ownership rules set forth in the code , as well as shares of our capital stock actually owned by the u . s . holder , must generally be taken into account . because the determination as to whether any of the alternative tests of section {num} ( b ) of the code will be satisfied with respect to the united states holder depends upon the facts and circumstances at the time the determination is made , united states holders are urged to consult their tax advisors to determine such tax treatment . 
if a redemption or repurchase of shares of our stock is treated as a distribution taxable as a dividend , the amount of the distribution will be measured by the amount of cash and the fair market value of any property received . see " —distributions generally . " a united states holder's adjusted basis in the redeemed or repurchased shares of the stock for tax purposes will be transferred to its remaining shares of our capital stock , if any . if a united states holder owns no other shares of our capital stock , such basis may , under certain circumstances , be transferred to a related person or it may be lost entirely . proposed treasury regulations issued in {num} if enacted in their current form , would affect the basis recovery rules described above . it is not clear whether these proposed regulations will be enacted in their current form or at all . prospective investors are urged to consult their tax advisors regarding the federal income tax consequences of a redemption or repurchase of our capital stock . 
if a redemption or repurchase of shares of our stock is not treated as a distribution taxable as a dividend , it will be treated as a taxable sale or exchange in the manner described under " —dispositions of our capital stock . " 
information reporting and backup withholding 
we are required to report to our united states holders and the irs the amount of dividends paid during each calendar year , and the amount of any tax withheld . under the backup withholding rules , a united states holder may be subject to backup withholding with respect to dividends paid unless the holder is a corporation or comes within certain other exempt categories and , when required , demonstrates this fact , or provides a taxpayer identification number , certifies as to no loss of exemption from backup withholding , and otherwise complies with applicable requirements of the backup withholding rules . a united states holder that does not provide us with its correct taxpayer identification number may also be subject to penalties imposed by the irs . backup withholding is not an additional tax . any amount paid as backup withholding will be creditable against the united states holder's federal income tax liability , provided the required information is timely furnished to the irs . in addition , we may be required to withhold a portion of capital gain distributions to any stockholders who fail to certify their non-foreign status . see " —taxation of non-united states holders . " 
taxation of tax-exempt stockholders 
dividend income from us and gain arising upon a sale of our shares generally should not be unrelated business taxable income , or ubti , to a tax-exempt stockholder , except as described below . all or a portion of such dividend income will be ubti if a tax-exempt stockholder holds its shares as " debt-financed property " within the meaning of the code , and all or a portion of such gain will be ubti if a tax-exempt stockholder holds its shares as debt financed property or as inventory or property held for sale to customers in the ordinary course of the trade or business of the tax-exempt stockholder . generally , " debt-financed property " is property , the acquisition or holding of which is , directly or indirectly , financed through a borrowing by the tax-exempt stockholder . 
for tax-exempt stockholders that are social clubs , voluntary employee benefit associations , supplemental unemployment benefit trusts , or qualified group legal services plans exempt from federal income taxation under sections {num} ( c ) ( 7 ) , ( c ) ( 9 ) , ( c ) ( {num} ) or ( c ) ( {num} ) of the code , respectively , income from an investment in our capital stock will constitute ubti unless the organization is able to properly claim a deduction for amounts set aside or placed in reserve for specific purposes so as to offset the income generated by its investment in our capital stock . these prospective investors are urged to consult their tax advisors concerning these " set aside " and reserve requirements . 
{num} 
notwithstanding the above , however , a portion of the dividends paid by a " pension-held reit " may be treated as ubti as to certain trusts that hold more than {num}% , by value , of the interests in the reit . a reit will not be a " pension-held reit " if it is able to satisfy the " not closely held " requirement without relying on the " look-through " exception with respect to certain trusts or if such reit is not " predominantly held " by " qualified trusts . " as a result of restrictions on the transfer and ownership of stock contained in our charter , we do not expect to be classified as a " pension-held reit , " and as a result , the tax treatment described in this paragraph should be inapplicable to our stockholders . however , because our stock is publicly traded , we cannot guarantee that this is or will always be the case . 
taxation of non-united states holders 
the following discussion addresses the rules governing united states federal income taxation of the purchase , ownership and disposition of our capital stock by non-united states holders . these rules are complex , and no attempt is made herein to provide more than a brief summary of such rules . accordingly , the discussion does not address all aspects of united states federal income taxation that may be relevant to a non-united states holder in light of its particular circumstances and does not address any state , local or foreign tax consequences or tax consequence arising from any united states federal tax other than income tax . we urge non-united states holders to consult their tax advisors to determine the impact of federal , state , local , foreign and other tax laws on the purchase , ownership , and disposition of shares of our capital stock , including any tax return filing and other reporting requirements . 
distributions generally . distributions ( including any taxable stock dividends ) that are neither attributable to gain from our sale or exchange of united states real property interests , or usrpis , nor designated by us as capital gain dividends will be treated as dividends ( except as described below ) of ordinary income to the extent that they are made out of our current or accumulated earnings and profits . such distributions ordinarily will be subject to withholding of united states federal income tax at a {num}% rate or such lower rate as may be specified by an applicable income tax treaty unless the distributions are treated as effectively connected with the conduct by the non-united states holder of a united states trade or business . under certain treaties , however , lower withholding rates generally applicable to dividends do not apply to dividends from a reit . certain certification and disclosure requirements must be satisfied to be exempt from withholding under the effectively connected income exemption . dividends that are treated as effectively connected with such a trade or business ( and , if a tax treaty applies , are attributable to a u . s . permanent establishment of the non-united states holder ) will generally not be subject to withholding but will be subject to united states federal income tax on a net basis at graduated rates , in the same manner as dividends paid to united states holders are subject to tax . any such dividends received by a non-united states holder that is a corporation may also be subject to an additional branch profits tax at a {num}% rate or such lower rate as may be specified by an applicable income tax treaty . 
distributions in excess of our current and accumulated earnings and profits will not be taxable to a non-united states holder to the extent that such distributions do not exceed the non-united states holder's adjusted tax basis in our capital stock , but rather will reduce the adjusted tax basis of such stock . to the extent that these distributions exceed the non-united states holder's adjusted tax basis in our capital stock , they will give rise to gain from the sale or exchange of such stock . the tax treatment of this gain is described below . 
for withholding purposes , because we generally cannot determine at the time we make a distribution whether the distribution will exceed our current and accumulated earnings and profits , we expect to treat all distributions as made out of our current or accumulated earnings and profits . except with respect to certain distributions attributable to the sale of united states real property interests as described below , we expect to withhold united states income tax at the rate of {num}% on any distributions made to a non-united states holder unless : 
· 
a lower treaty rate applies and the non-united states holder provides us with an irs form w-8ben or w-8ben-e ( or other applicable documentation ) evidencing eligibility for that reduced treaty rate ; or 
· 
the non-united states holder provides us with an irs form w-8eci claiming that the distribution is income effectively connected with a united states trade or business of the non-united states holder . 
any amounts withheld should generally be refundable if it is subsequently determined that the distribution was , in fact , in excess of our current and accumulated earnings and profits , provided certain conditions are met . 
capital gain dividends and distributions attributable to a sale or exchange of united states real property interests . distributions to a non-united states holder that we properly designate as capital gain dividends , other than those arising from the disposition of a usrpi , generally should not be subject to united states federal income taxation , unless : 
{enum} 
the investment in our capital stock is treated as effectively connected with the non-united states holder's united states trade or business ( and , if a tax treaty applies , are attributable to a u . s . permanent establishment of the non-united states holder ) , in which case the non-united states holder will be subject to the same treatment as united states holders with respect to such gain , except that a non-united states holder that is a foreign corporation may also be subject to the {num}% branch profits tax , as discussed above ; or 
{num} 
{enum} 
the non-united states holder is a nonresident alien individual who is present in the united states for {num} days or more during the taxable year and certain other conditions are met , in which case the nonresident alien individual will be subject to a {num}% tax on the individual's capital gains ( reduced by certain capital losses ) . 
pursuant to the foreign investment in real property tax act , or firpta , distributions to a non-united states holder that are attributable to gain from our sale or exchange of usrpis , whether or not designated as capital gain dividends , will cause the non- united states holder to be treated as recognizing such gain as income effectively connected with a united states trade or business . non-united states holders would generally be taxed at the same rates applicable to united states holders , subject to any applicable alternative minimum tax , and any non-united states holder that is a non-united states corporation may also be subject to a branch profits tax of up to {num}% , as discussed above . we also will be required to withhold and to remit to the irs {num}% ( or {num}% to the extent provided in treasury regulations ) of any distribution to a non-united states holder to the extent attributable to gain from sales or exchanges by us of usrpis . the amount withheld is creditable against the non-united states holder's united states federal income tax liability . however , any distribution with respect to any class of stock that is " regularly traded " on an established securities market located in the united states is not subject to firpta , and therefore , not subject to the {num}% u . s . withholding tax described above , if the non-united states holder did not own more than {num}% of such class of stock at any time during the one-year period ending on the date of the distribution . instead , such distributions generally will be treated in the same manner as ordinary dividend distributions and subject to withholding in the manner described above with respect to ordinary dividends . in addition , distributions to certain non-united states publicly traded shareholders that meet certain record-keeping and other requirements ( " qualified shareholders " ) are exempt from firpta , except to the extent owners of such qualified shareholders that are not also qualified shareholders own , actually or constructively , more than {num}% of our capital stock . furthermore , distributions to " qualified foreign pension funds " or entities all of the interests of which are held by " qualified foreign pension funds " are exempt from firpta . non-united states holders should consult their tax advisors regarding the application of these rules . 
retention of net capital gains . although the law is not clear on the matter , it appears that amounts designated by us as retained net capital gains in respect of the capital stock held by united states holders generally should be treated with respect to non-united states holders in the same manner as actual distributions by us of capital gain dividends . under this approach , the non-united states holder would be able to offset as a credit against its united states federal income tax liability resulting from its proportionate share of the tax paid by us on such retained net capital gains , and to receive from the irs a refund to the extent their proportionate share of such tax paid by us exceeds its actual united states federal income tax liability , provided that the u . s . holder furnishes required information to the irs on a timely basis . if we were to designate any portion of our net capital gain as retained net capital gain , non-united states holders are urged to consult their tax advisors regarding the taxation of such retained net capital gain . 
sale of our capital stock . gain recognized by a non-united states holder upon the sale , exchange or other taxable disposition of our capital stock generally will not be subject to united states federal income taxation unless such stock constitutes a united states real property interest within the meaning of firpta . our capital stock will not constitute a united states real property interest so long as we are a " domestically-controlled qualified investment entity . " a domestically-controlled qualified investment entity includes a reit in which at all times during a specified testing period less than {num}% in value of its stock is held directly or indirectly by non-united states holders , subject to certain rules . for purposes of determining whether a reit is a " domestically controlled qualified investment entity , " a person who at all applicable times holds less than 5 percent of a class of stock that is " regularly traded " is treated as a united states person unless the reit has actual knowledge that such person is not a united state person . we believe , but cannot guarantee , that we have been a domestically-controlled qualified investment entity . in addition , because our capital stock is publicly traded , no assurance can be given that we will continue to be a domestically-controlled qualified investment entity . 
notwithstanding the foregoing , gain from the sale , exchange or other taxable disposition of our capital stock not otherwise subject to firpta will be taxable to a non-united states holder if either ( 1 ) the investment in our capital stock is treated as effectively connected with the non-united states holder's united states trade or business ( and , if required by an applicable treaty , attributable to a permanent establishment ) , in which case the non-u . s . holder will be subject to the same treatment as united states holders with respect to such gain , except that a non-united states holder that is a corporation may also be subject to a branch profits tax of up to {num}% , as discussed above , or ( 2 ) the non-united states holder is a nonresident alien individual who is present in the united states for {num} days or more during the taxable year and certain other conditions are met , in which case the nonresident alien individual will be subject to a {num}% tax on the individual's capital gains ( reduced by certain capital losses ) . in addition , in general , even if we are a domestically controlled qualified investment entity , upon disposition of our capital stock , a non-united states holder may be treated as having gain from the sale or other taxable disposition of a usrpi if the non-united states holder ( or certain of its affiliate or related parties ) ( 1 ) disposes of our capital stock within a {num}-day period preceding the ex-dividend date of a distribution , any portion of which , but for the disposition , would have been treated as gain from the sale or exchange of a usrpi and ( 2 ) acquires , or enters into a contract or option to acquire , or is deemed to acquire , other shares of that stock during the {num}-day period beginning with the first day of the {num}-day period described in clause ( 1 ) . the preceding sentence shall not apply to a non-united states holder if the non-united states holder did not own more than 5% of the stock at any time during the one-year period ending on the date of the distribution described in clause ( 1 ) of the preceding sentence and the class of stock is " regularly traded , " as defined in applicable treasury regulations . non-united states holders should contact their tax advisors regarding the tax consequences of any sale , exchange , or other taxable disposition of our capital stock . 
{num} 
even if we do not qualify as a " domestically-controlled qualified investment entity " at the time a non-united states holder sells or exchanges our capital stock , gain arising from such a sale or other taxable disposition by a non-united states holder of such stock would not be subject to united states taxation under firpta as a sale of a usrpi if : 
{enum} 
our capital stock is " regularly traded , " as defined by applicable treasury regulations , on an established securities market such as the new york stock exchange ; and 
{enum} 
such non-united states holder owned , actually and constructively , {num}% or less of our capital stock throughout the applicable testing period . 
in addition , dispositions of our capital stock by qualified shareholders are exempt from firpta , except to the extent owners of such qualified shareholders that are not also qualified shareholders own , actually or constructively , more than {num}% of our capital stock . furthermore , dispositions of our capital stock by " qualified foreign pension funds " or entities all of the interests of which are held by " qualified foreign pension funds " are exempt from firpta . non-united states holders should consult their tax advisors regarding the application of these rules . 
if gain on the sale , exchange or other taxable disposition of our capital stock were subject to taxation under firpta , the non-united states holder would be subject to regular united states federal income tax with respect to such gain in the same manner as a taxable united states holder ( subject to any applicable alternative minimum tax and a special alternative minimum tax in the case of nonresident alien individuals ) . in addition , if the sale , exchange or other taxable disposition of our capital stock were subject to taxation under firpta , and if shares of such stock were not " regularly traded " on an established securities market , the purchaser of such stock would be required to withhold and remit to the irs {num}% ( {num}% for dispositions occurring after february {num} {num} ) of the purchase price . if amounts withheld on a sale , redemption , repurchase , or exchange of our common stock exceed the non-united states holder's substantive tax liability resulting from such disposition , such excess may be refunded or credited against such non-united states holder's federal income tax liability , provided that the required information is provided to the irs on a timely basis . amounts withheld on any such sale , exchange or other taxable disposition of our common stock may not satisfy a non-united states holder's entire tax liability under firpta , and such non-united states holder remains liable for the timely payment of any remaining tax liability . 
information reporting and backup withholding . generally , we must report annually to the irs the amount of dividends paid to a non-united states holder , such holder's name and address , and the amount of tax withheld , if any . a similar report is sent to the non-united states holder . pursuant to tax treaties or other agreements , the irs may make its reports available to tax authorities in the non-united states holder's country of residence . 
payments of dividends or of proceeds from the disposition of stock made to a non-united states holder may be subject to information reporting and backup withholding unless such holder establishes an exemption , for example , by properly certifying its non-united states status on an irs form w-8ben or w-8ben-e or another appropriate version of irs form w-{num} notwithstanding the foregoing , backup withholding and information reporting may apply if either we have or our paying agent has actual knowledge , or reason to know , that a non-united states holder is a united states person . 
backup withholding is not an additional tax . rather , the united states income tax liability of persons subject to backup withholding will be reduced by the amount of tax withheld . if withholding results in an overpayment of taxes , a refund or credit may be obtained , provided that the required information is timely furnished to the irs . 
taxation of holders of our debt securities 
the following summary describes the material united states federal income tax consequences of acquiring , owning and disposing of our debt securities . this discussion assumes the debt securities will be issued with no more than a de minimis amount of original issue discount for united states federal income tax purposes . in addition , this discussion is limited to persons purchasing the debt securities for cash at original issue and at their original " issue price " within the meaning of section {num} of the code ( i . e . , the first price at which a substantial amount of the debt securities is sold to the public for cash ) . 
taxable united states holders of our debt securities 
interest . a united states holder generally will be required to recognize and include in gross income any stated interest as ordinary income at the time it is paid or accrued on the debt securities in accordance with such u . s . holder's method of accounting for united states federal income tax purposes . 
sale or other taxable disposition of the debt securities . a united states holder will recognize gain or loss on the sale , exchange , redemption ( including a partial redemption ) , retirement or other taxable disposition of a debt security equal to the difference between the sum of the cash and the fair market value of any property received in exchange therefor ( less a portion allocable to any accrued and unpaid stated interest , which generally will be taxable as ordinary income if not previously included in such u . s . holder's 
{num} 
income ) and the united states holder's adjusted tax basis in the debt security . a united states holder's adjusted tax basis in a debt security ( or a portion thereof ) generally will be the united states holder's cost therefor decreased by any payment on the debt security other than a payment of qualified stated interest . this gain or loss generally will be long-term capital gain or loss if the united states holder has held the debt securities for more than one year at the time of such disposition . the deductibility of capital losses is subject to limitation . 
backup withholding and information reporting . a united states holder may be subject to information reporting and backup withholding when such united states holder receives interest and principal payments on the debt securities or proceeds upon the sale or other disposition of such debt securities ( including a redemption or retirement of the debt securities ) . certain holders ( including , among others , corporations and certain tax-exempt organizations ) are generally not subject to information reporting or backup withholding . a united states holder will be subject to backup withholding if such united states holder is not otherwise exempt and : 
· 
such united states holder fails to furnish its taxpayer identification number , or " tin , " which , for an individual is ordinarily his or her social security number ; 
· 
the irs notifies the payor that such holder furnished an incorrect tin ;

a united states holder is urged to consult its tax advisor regarding its qualification for an exemption from backup withholding and the procedures for obtaining such an exemption , if applicable . backup withholding is not an additional tax . any amounts withheld under the backup withholding rules from a payment to a united states holder will be allowed as a credit against the holder's united states federal income tax liability or may be refunded , provided the required information is furnished in a timely manner to the irs . 
non-united states holders of our debt securities

" such entities are encouraged to consult their tax advisors to determine the united states federal , state , local and other tax consequences that may be relevant to them . 
{enum} interest paid to a non-united states holder on its debt securities that is not effectively connected with such non-united states holder's conduct of a united states trade or business will not be subject to united states federal withholding tax , provided that : 
· 
such non-united states holder does not actually or constructively own a {num}% or greater interest in the total combined voting power of all classes of our voting stock ;

a non-united states holder generally will also be exempt from withholding tax on interest if such amount is effectively connected with such non-united states holder's conduct of a united states trade or business and the non-united states holder provides us with appropriate certification ( as discussed below under " —non-united states holders of our debt securities—united states trade or business " ) . 
{num} 
if a non-united states holder does not satisfy the requirements above , interest paid to such non-united states holder generally will be subject to a {num}% united states federal withholding tax . such rate may be reduced or eliminated under a tax treaty between the united states and the non-united states holder's country of residence . to claim a reduction or exemption under a tax treaty , a non-united states holder must generally complete an irs form w-8ben or w-8ben-e ( or applicable successor form ) and claim the reduction or exemption on the form . 
sale or other taxable disposition of the debt securities . a non-united states holder generally will not be subject to united states federal income tax or withholding tax on gain recognized on the sale , exchange , redemption , retirement or other taxable disposition of a debt security unless ( 1 ) the gain is effectively connected with the conduct by the non-united states holder of a united states trade or business ( and , if a tax treaty applies , the gain is attributable to a united states permanent establishment maintained by such non-united states holder ) and ( 2 ) in the case of a non-united states holder who is an individual , such non-united states holder is present in the united states for {num} days or more in the taxable year of disposition and certain other requirements are met . gain described in ( 1 ) above will be subject to tax in the manner described below under " —united states trade or business .

united states trade or business . if interest paid on a debt security or gain from a disposition of a debt security is effectively connected with a non-united states holder's conduct of a united states trade or business ( and , if an income tax treaty applies , the non-united states holder maintains a united states permanent establishment to which such amounts are generally attributable ) , the non-united states holder generally will be subject to united states federal income tax on the interest or gain on a net basis in the same manner as if it were a u . s . holder . if a non-united states holder is subject to united states federal income tax on the interest on a net basis , the {num}% withholding tax described above will not apply ( assuming an appropriate certification is provided , generally on irs form w-8eci ) . a non-united states holder that is a corporation may be subject to a branch profits tax equal to {num}% of its effectively connected earnings and profits for the taxable year , subject to certain adjustments , unless it qualifies for a lower rate under an applicable income tax treaty . for this purpose , interest on a debt security or gain from a disposition of a debt security will be included in earnings and profits if the interest or gain is effectively connected with the conduct by the corporation of a united states trade or business . 
backup withholding and information reporting . a non-united states holder generally will not be subject to backup withholding and information reporting with respect to payments that we make to the non-united states holder , provided that we do not have actual knowledge or reason to know that such non-united states holder is a " united states person , " within the meaning of the code , and the non-united states holder has given us the statement described above under " non-united states holders of our debt securities—interest . " in addition , a non-united states holder will not be subject to backup withholding or information reporting with respect to the proceeds of the sale or other disposition of our debt securities ( including a retirement or redemption of such debt securities ) within the united states or conducted through certain u . s . -related brokers , if the payor receives the statement described above and does not have actual knowledge or reason to know that such non-united states holder is a united states person or the non-united states holder otherwise establishes an exemption . however , we may be required to report annually to the irs and to the non-united states holder the amount of , and the tax withheld with respect to , any interest paid to the non-united states holder , regardless of whether any tax was actually withheld . copies of these information returns may also be made available under the provisions of a specific treaty or agreement to the tax authorities of the country in which the non-united states holder resides . 
a non-united states holder generally will be entitled to credit any amounts withheld under the backup withholding rules against the non-united states holder's united states federal income tax liability or may claim a refund provided that the required information is furnished to the irs in a timely manner . 
tax rates 
currently , the maximum tax rate for non-corporate taxpayers for ( 1 ) capital gains , including certain " capital gain dividends , " is generally {num}% ( although depending on the characteristics of the assets which produced these gains and on designations which we may make , certain capital gain dividends may be taxed at a {num}% rate ) and ( 2 ) " qualified dividend income " is generally {num}% . however , dividends payable by reits are not eligible for the {num}% tax rate on qualified dividend income , except to the extent that certain holding requirements have been met and the reit's dividends are attributable to dividends received by the reit from taxable corporations ( such as its taxable reit subsidiaries ) , to income that was subject to tax at the corporate / reit level ( for example , if the reit distributed taxable income that it retained and paid tax on in the prior taxable year ) , or to dividends properly designated by the reit as " capital gain dividends . " in addition , united states stockholders that are corporations may be required to treat up to {num}% of some capital gain dividends as ordinary income . 
medicare tax on unearned income . certain united states holders that are individuals , estates or trusts are required to pay an additional {num}% tax on , among other things , dividends , interest on and capital gains from the sale or other disposition of stock or debt obligations . united states stockholders are urged to consult their tax advisors regarding the effect , if any , of these rules on their ownership and disposition of our capital stock or debt securities . 
{num} 
foreign accounts 
withholding taxes may apply to certain types of payments made to " foreign financial institutions " ( as defined in the code ) and certain other non-united states entities . specifically , a {num}% withholding tax may be imposed on dividends and interest on , and gross proceeds from the sale or other disposition of , our capital stock or debt securities paid to a foreign financial institution or to a non-financial foreign entity , unless ( 1 ) the foreign financial institution undertakes certain diligence and reporting , ( 2 ) the non-financial foreign entity either certifies it does not have any substantial united states owners or furnishes identifying information regarding each substantial united states owner , or ( 3 ) the foreign financial institution or non-financial foreign entity otherwise qualifies for an exemption from these rules . if the payee is a foreign financial institution and is subject to the diligence and reporting requirements in clause ( 1 ) above , it must enter into an agreement with the united states treasury requiring , among other things , that it undertake to identify accounts held by certain united states persons or united states-owned foreign entities , annually report certain information about such accounts , and withhold {num}% on payments to non-compliant foreign financial institutions and certain other account holders . foreign financial institutions located in jurisdictions that have an intergovernmental agreement with the united states governing these rules may be subject to different rules . 
the withholding provisions described above generally apply to payments of dividends or interest and will apply to payments of gross proceeds from a sale , redemption or other disposition of stock or debt securities ( including payments of principal ) on or after january {num} {num} because we may not know the extent to which a distribution is a dividend for united states federal income tax purposes at the time it is made , for purposes of these withholding rules we may treat the entire distribution as a dividend . prospective investors should consult their tax advisors regarding these withholding provisions . 
other tax consequences 
state , local and foreign income tax laws may differ substantially from the corresponding federal income tax laws , and this discussion does not purport to describe any aspect of the tax laws of any state , local or foreign jurisdiction or any federal tax other than the income tax . you are urged to consult your tax advisors regarding the effect of federal , state , local and foreign tax laws with respect to our tax treatment as a reit and on an investment in our securities .
