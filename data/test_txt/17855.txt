dear fellow shareholder : 
as previously announced , the board of directors of bar harbor bankshares ( the " company " ) declared a quarterly cash dividend of ${num} per share of common stock payable september {num} {num} to shareholders of record as of august {num} {num} this cash dividend represents an increase of {num} cents , or {num}% , compared with the prior quarter . further , it represents an increase of {num} cents or {num}% compared with the third quarter of {num} this represents our twenty-first consecutive quarter with a dividend increase . 
for your convenience , i have enclosed our earnings press release and selected unaudited financial data for the three and six months ended june {num} {num} 
i am pleased to present the following highlights from the quarter and through the first half of the year : 
 
net income amounted to ${num} million , which represented an increase of ${num} thousand or {num}% compared with the second quarter of {num} the company also announced record net income of ${num} million for the six months ended june {num} {num} representing an increase of ${num} thousand , or {num}% , compared with the same period in {num} 
 
diluted earnings per share were ${num} for the quarter , representing an increase of ${num} or {num}% , compared with the second quarter of {num} 
 
total assets at june {num} {num} totaled ${num} billion , representing an increase of ${num} million , or {num}% , compared with december {num} {num} we continue to achieve growth across asset categories and remain keenly focused on risk management as the landscape for asset generation has further gained in intensity . 
 
total loans as of june {num} {num} stood at ${num} billion , representing an increase of ${num} million , or {num}% , compared with year end . i have been repeatedly commenting on the deepening competition and its impact on pricing and disciplined loan structure . our ability to continue to grow this segment while holding to principles is a credit to a statewide prospecting plan and reaffirming our risk appetite at every opportunity . 
 
total non-performing loans continued to decline , falling another ${num} million , or {num}% from year-end december {num} {num} to ${num} million . to further illustrate our position with regard to problem loan management , total non-performing loans expressed as a percentage of total loans ended the quarter at {num}% , down from {num}% at year-end {num} 
 
tax-equivalent net interest income , our principal revenue source for the three months ended june {num} {num} totaled ${num} million , representing an increase of ${num} thousand , or {num}% compared with the second quarter of {num} we realize that due to the rates being offered in our markets , we must strongly convey the value of relationships and increase the number of new loan

opportunities that we review . reduction in our tax-equivalent net interest margin of 8 basis points underscores our relative success in consistently communicating the correlation between service and pricing . furthermore , we feel risk is not being adequately compensated at the farther end of the risk spectrum , hence our preference toward stabilized credit opportunities . as we see price pressures affecting loan opportunities , so too must we remain steadfast in our careful approach to funding costs especially given the impact of the fed funds rate increase in december of {num} 
 
for the three months ended june {num} {num} our return on average equity , return on average assets , and efficiency ratio were {num}% , {num}% , and {num}% , respectively . these industry benchmarks are the result of our strong earnings and reflect the efforts of a committed team that has accepted the challenge to relentlessly pursue the evolution of our company . the related increase in expenses is associated with necessary infrastructure development in recent years prior to the pending lake sunapee bank group ( " lsbg " ) acquisition previously announced on may {num} {num} in addition , the second quarter non-interest expense included ${num} thousand in non-recurring expenses related to the lsbg merger , largely legal and other professional fees . 
 
our capital measures for both the company and our bank remain well above applicable regulatory standards for " well-capitalized " financial institutions . 
as you can see in our performance , our teams value every relationship and are committed to being " thought providers " to our customers rather than simply taking requests . this is the only way to be compensated for the value we provide through our many longstanding relationships as well as the new customers being added each month . our focus will always be on the on the right growth as a long term value creator , rather than growth for growth's sake to drive a quarter's performance . 
we expect that existing lsbg branches will continue to operate under the lake sunapee brand after the merger is completed . while a fully detailed proxy will be mailed detailing the lsbg transaction in greater detail , this opportunity is about seeking diversified growth across a broader footprint while not abandoning our roots as a true community bank . our two like-minded institutions would be the only community bank currently operating in the three states and leverage our scale to continue to responsibly invest in our company , our people , and the communities we call home . 
the consummation of the lsbg merger is subject to various conditions , including ( i ) receipt of the requisite approval of the merger agreement and merger by the shareholders of our company and lsbg shareholders , ( ii ) receipt of all required regulatory approvals , ( iii ) the absence of any law or order prohibiting the closing of the merger , and ( iv ) the effectiveness of the registration statement filed by the company with the securities and exchange commission ( " sec " ) with respect to our company's common stock to be issued in the merger .

we continue to make progress in the approvals as outlined above . in addition , we have filed our proxy with the sec , outlining our shareholder meeting date , record date , and details of the merger . for shareholders of record as of august {num} {num} please be watching for your proxy mailing and voting cards in advance of our october special meeting . 
as always , we remain committed to our model and to further evolving our institution to improve employee and customer experiences . keys to this and the lsbg merger will be communication , security , credit discipline , and compliance maintenance at every opportunity . headwinds are a given , however we continue to be proud of the performance we are able to report to you , our valued shareholders . 
respectfully ,
