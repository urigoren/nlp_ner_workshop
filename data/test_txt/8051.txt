now , we'll turn the call over to howie rosen . 
{enum} howie rosen : thank you , tim . 
good morning and thank you for joining our press briefing on the sap{num} clinical trial results for arx-{num} a late state investigational product candidate being developed by acelrx pharmaceuticals . 
my name is howie rosen . i'm the chief executive officer of acelrx . i'm here today at the emergency nurses association {num} conference with three members of my senior management team : dr . pamela palmer , who is our chief medical officer and a cofounder of acelrx ; gina ford , who serves as vice president commercial strategy ; and tim morris our chief financial officer and head of business development . 
arx-{num} is being developed for the management of moderate-to-severe acute pain in medically-supervised settings . also known as sufentanil sublingual tablet {num} micrograms , arx-{num} is a synthetic opioid analgesic with a novel , non-invasive route of administration . designed to be delivered sublingually , arx-{num} consists of a very small {num}-microgram sufentanil tablet that is administered under the patient's tongue by a healthcare professional using a disposable pre-filled single dose applicator , or sda . 
today on behalf of acelrx , my team and i are very pleased to announce positive safety and efficacy results for arx-{num} in the sap{num} trial , which is the third phase 3 trial in the arx-{num} clinical development program . 
i'll now turn it over to pam , who will give you an overview of the sap{num} trial . 
{enum} pamela palmer : thanks , howie . 
the primary objective of sap{num} was to evaluate the safety of arx-{num} in postoperative patients , especially in higher risk patients , such as the elderly or those with comorbidities or impaired organ function . 
before i get to the results , let me briefly give you some background on the trial and why it was conducted . at a pre-nda meeting in december {num} the fda review team agreed that the safety database requirements for the arx-{num} nda could be supplemented with data for patients who received two {num}-microgram doses of zalviso within {num} to {num} minutes , which is another sublingual sufentanil product from acelrx . 
zalviso is now approved in the eu and is in late stage development in the u . s . but , fda agreement to supplement the arx-{num} safety database with these zalviso patients came with two important requirements . the majority of the required safety data for the arx-{num} nda should be comprised of patients exposed to arx-{num} and the remainder of the required safety database for {num} most also evaluate the potential risks to vulnerable populations , such as the elderly , patients with hepatic or renal impairment , or patients with american society of anesthesiologists , or asa , physical status classification 2 or {num} such patients may be a particular risk for anticipated adverse events , for example opioid related adverse events , such as life threatening cns or respiratory depression or unanticipated adverse effects .

to satisfy these fda requirements , acelrx proposed running this phase 3 sap{num} trial , an open label , single arm , {num}-hour safety study that would seek to enroll elderly patients and patients with comorbidity . in sap{num} safety variables included the assessment of adverse events , vital signs , including blood pressure , heart rate , respiratory rate and oxygen saturation . assessing efficacy was a secondary objective in the trial . the primary efficacy variable was a time weighted summed pain intensity difference over the {num}-hour study period , or spid{num} and secondary efficacy variables included pain intensity and pain relief by evaluation time points . 
the mean age for all patients in sap{num} was {num} years and {num} percent of patients were {num} years of age or older . more than one in four patients , or {num} percent , had some degree of baseline hepatic and / or renal impairment . nearly seven in {num} patients , {num} percent , were asa physical status class 2 or {num} which means mild or severe systemic disease . 
safety results showed that , overall there were no differences in adverse events between patients with normal and impaired liver function , or between patients with normal and impaired renal function . no clinically meaningful changes from baseline and vital signs or oxygen saturation were observed in the population and no opioid reversal agents were needed in the study . regardless of age and organ function , approximately two in three patients had no adverse events during the study , {num} percent of all patients had no adverse events , {num} percent of those aged {num} years or older had no adverse events and {num} percent of those with hepatic impairment , and {num} percent of those with renal impairment had no adverse events . the most common adverse events were nausea and headache . 
during the {num}-hour study period the mean total number of arx-{num} doses administered was {num} which was similar for patients with normal and impaired liver function and for patients with normal and impaired renal function . the mean interdosing interval was more three hours at {num} minutes . the primary and secondary efficacy endpoint showed a reduction in pain intensity starting at {num} minutes after the first dose of arx-{num} followed by {num} percent , {num} percent and {num} percent reduction in mean pain intensity from baseline at one hour , two hours and {num} hours , respectively . the baseline pain score was {num} on average . 
finally , on a global assessment of arx-{num} as a method of pain control , {num} percent of healthcare professionals and {num} percent of patients responded good or excellent . today's report of these data marks the completion of the arx-{num} phase 3 clinical program , which comprises sap{num} and two earlier phase 3 trials in patients with moderate-to-severe acute pain . sap{num} which was an ambulatory surgery pivotal study that reported positive results in {num} at the american society of anesthesiologists annual meeting , and sap{num} which was an emergency room study that reported positive results in {num} at the military health system research symposium , or mhsrs . in addition , the pivotal phase 2 sap{num} trial reported positive results in {num} at the {num}th annual post graduate assembly in anesthesiology . 
with data from all four trials and supplemental safety data from the zalviso trial , acelrx intends to submit an nda for arx-{num} by the end of this year . the nda will seek approval of arx-{num} in the management of moderate-to-severe acute pain in medically-supervised settings . medically-supervised settings will include emergency medicine , outpatient or ambulatory surgery , non-surgical patients experiencing pain in the hospital or postoperative patients following short stay surgery who do not require more time--i'm sorry , more long-term analgesia . arx-{num} is intended to be administered only by a healthcare professional . 
gina will now talk about the commercial implications of the sap{num} results . 
{enum} gina ford : thanks , pam . 
our clinical data defines some important features of arx-{num} that may help address unmet needs in managing moderate-to-severe acute pain in medically-supervised settings . as a result , we anticipate a large market opportunity for arx-{num} for example , we know that in ambulatory surgical centers : hospitals , emergency departments and ambulances , healthcare professionals need an opioid analgesic that is safe and effective across many patient types . arx-{num} is being developed with that need in mind , including higher risk patients . we also know that from a time and efficiency perspective healthcare professionals need an opioid analgesic that offers straightforward administration . arx-{num} offers non-invasive sublingual administration , and the sap{num} data show that the average re-dosing interval was more than three hours at {num} minutes .

as howie mentioned , we're coming to you from the emergency nurses association annual meeting , where there are approximately {num} nurses attending . their annual meeting is a premium exchange for new technology and education . in speaking with these nurses here at ena , one of their concerns is workflow . we believe a product like arx-{num} that is easy to administer may help patient flow . 
and , finally , the sap{num} study , the data show that drug induced cognitive impairment was not seen with arx-{num} which could be beneficial to healthcare providers and their patients . we are developing arx-{num} to be a method of treating moderate-to-severe acute pain that is ( 1 ) safe and effective across many patients types , including higher risk patients ; ( 2 ) non-invasive and easy to administer ; and , ( 3 ) has a long duration of affect . the data from sap{num} will be an important part of the nda we intend to submit later this year . taken together , the clinical data from arx-{num} is positive , and we look forward to submitting the nda for market approval . 
according to the national emergency department sample , or neds , there were more than {num} million adult emergency room visits in the united states during {num} with more than {num} million involved in moderate-to-severe acute pain . in addition , there's evidence that patients who present to the er with high levels of pain are often under treated , a treatment gap known as oligoanalgesia . based on the national survey of ambulatory surgery of {num} an estimated {num} million adult patients underwent outpatient surgical procedures in the united states . of these , it's estimated that more {num} million patients experience moderate-to-severe acute pain . 
with the use of arx-{num} in medically-supervised settings , in addition to er and ambulatory surgery , the market potential of arx-{num} in the united states is expected to be ${num} billion . between now and the end of the year , we will continue our presence at medical meetings . in addition to ena , in september , we'll attend the american society of plastic surgeons meeting , also here in los angeles , and in october and november we will attend the european society for emergency medicine congress in vienna , austria , the ems world expo in new orleans , the american college of emergency physicians scientific assembly in las vegas , the international society for pharmacoeconomics and outcomes research european congress in vienna , austria , the obesity society meeting in new orleans , and the national commission on correctional healthcare conference in las vegas . 
thank you for your attention and your interest in arx-{num} and the sap{num} trial . tim will now lead our q&a session . 
{enum} timothy morris : uh , thank you , gina . 
so , for folks on the phone , we're happy to take your , uh , questions for , uh , howie , pam , uh , gina or myself .

{enum} ashley : great . thanks . uh , good morning , guys . this is ashley sp on for randall . uh , thanks for taking my questions . 
um , to start , i just wanted to start on , uh , the renal results . can you talk a little bit more about them? and is there any claim that can be made around this label--on the label? sorry . 
{enum} timothy morris : yeah , sorry , can you , um , repeat your question , ashley , at the beginning? 
{enum} ashley : yeah , sure . um , if you can just touch a little bit more , um , on the renal results and if there's any claim that can be made around it on the label . 
{enum} timothy morris : yeah , so , we'll ask pam , um , about that . so , your question is , you know , comment more on the , uh , results in the renal patients , uh , and is there any specific label claim we could make with regards to , um , potential benefit or treatment with renal patients . 
{enum} ashley : yep , exactly-- . 
{enum} pamela palmer : --sure , sure . and in fact , uh , the advantage of sufentanil is there is no active metabolite . and , as you know , metabolites are cleared by the kidneys . uh , the parent drug compound is metabolized by the liver . so , usually renal impairment is a concern in drugs that have active metabolites , because that's in fact how they're cleared , and that's the big issue with morphine and also an issue with hydromorphone as well . 
sufentanil has no active metabolites . and so , when we've looked in the past at studies of renal impairment versus normal , and including in the study , we actually see no difference in the plasma level of sufentanil in regular patients versus those with renal impairment . so , there just is not an impact . 
{enum} timothy morris : but , i suspect , we won't be able to make any specific label claim in terms of , um , benefits for renal impaired patients . i mean , it will be in the clinical trial section , but , uh , i don't believe , ashley , we'll be able to get anything specific in the label about , um , you know , for renal patients . 
{enum} pamela palmer : it's possible . we have population pk results that takes all of the data from all the studies , and it's possible that that data might make into the label talking about the effective organ impairment on , uh , the pharmacokinetics , which , in fact , we haven't seen . 
{enum} ashley : got it . and just one , uh , quick follow up , um , on zalviso is the pivotal trial still expected to move forward by the end of this month? 
{enum} howie rosen : hi . thanks . uh , this is howie . and we are still , uh , moving towards starting that by the end of the month , the zalviso trial . 
{enum} ashley : great . thank you .

{enum} ed arce : hi , everyone . uh , congrats on the data . um , i have a few questions . uh , the first one is on , uh , the , uh , primary--or i guess the secondary , uh , endpoint , which is the--uh , the efficacy endpoint , the spid{num} what was the , uh , numerical value there and the p value if you could give that? 
{enum} pamela palmer : uh , sure . uh , we didn't report it ‘cause it doesn't really clinically mean anything . i mean the spid{num} in the study was {num} um , there is no p value . it's just a single arm study , and there's nothing to compare it to . 
uh , what the fda does do is they look at all of our trials in total when they look at the integrated summary of efficacy in the nda filing . and , you know , as opposed to , for example , in our sap{num} study our spid{num} was {num} that we reported . so , we had great efficacy in the study , but it just numerically doesn't really mean anything in context by itself . you have to look at it in context with all the other studies we've run . 
{enum} ed arce : right . great . um , okay . and then-- . 
{enum} pamela palmer : --some higher is better . i should say this , a greater spid{num} is--it means more efficacy . 
{enum} ed arce : right . um , did you--have you , um , prepared the mean pain scores yet at one , two and {num} hours? 
{enum} pamela palmer : we do have pain scores for individual time points , and we'll be , uh , reporting all of that data along with more detailed adverse event profiles , uh , later . 
{enum} ed arce : okay . um , a couple more , if i may . um , on the safety side , uh , you noted , uh , headache and nausea as the two primary aes in this study . uh , do you have the--um , the percentages? i know they're fairly low . um , just wanted to know what the numbers were for those-- . 
{enum} pamela palmer : --yeah , they were-- . 
{enum} ed arce : --proportion-- . 
{enum} pamela palmer : --very low . they were very low in this study , uh , which we're glad to see . the nausea was , uh , {num} percent and the headache was 6 percent . and so , you can imagine the other adverse events were very low . 
{enum} ed arce : right . okay . um , and i know that the army has been--for quite a while been funding development of arx-{num} actually since , uh , the very beginning and i know this is going to continue through at least nda filing . i was wondering , um , how do you see your funding needs , uh , as you begin to ramp up , uh , commercial preparations? 
{enum} timothy morris : yeah , ed , this is the tim . the contract for the , uh , dod actually goes through the first quarter of next year ‘cause they have agreed to pay for , um , you know , the filing fee and any additional studies . so , uh , from a funding standpoint we haven't given any guidance for {num} spending . uh , we still reiterate our guidance that we should end this year with a cash balance of between {num} and {num} million . uh , i still think on kind of on a quarterly basis my burn's going to be around {num} million . the only trial we'll have ongoing in {num} for now will be the , uh , iap{num} study . uh , we do hope to invest into the commercial opportunity here . uh , but we will give , um , some guidance , uh , i think on our third quarter call .

{enum} ed arce : okay , great and congrats again , everyone . 
{enum} timothy morris : thank you , ed . 
operator : thank you . our next question comes from the line of michael higgins with roth capital . please proceed with your question . 
{enum} michael higgins : congratulations , guys , uh , very good data . it looks like it's a little better than what you've seen in previous trials . um , a couple of safety questions , a couple efficacy questions as well . in terms of safety , um , pardon me if you've given this already , but dropout rates and any reason for dropout rates , um , any color on that? 
{enum} pamela palmer : sure . we had a very high , uh , percentage of completers in this study . out of {num} patients , we had {num} completers with only eight dropouts . uh , half of those were due to adverse events and half were due to inadequate analgesia , which means the ae dropout rate was {num} percent and inadequate analgesia dropout rate was {num} percent and those are very , very low . 
{enum} michael higgins : um , let's jump to an efficacy question then . um , what--uh , what were the rescue , uh , meds that were used and how often were those used? 
{enum} pamela palmer : sure . rescue , uh , medication , as is typical with our studies , was iv morphine , and , uh , it was only used by {num} percent of the population , which again in these studies , um , of folks with an experimental pain medication is a very good result as well . 
{enum} michael higgins : yeah , i think that beats past trials . um , back to the safety , um , did you collect cognition data in this trial? 
{enum} pamela palmer : i'm sorry-- . 
{enum} timothy morris : --cognition data , uh , no-- . 
{enum} pamela palmer : --no . no , we didn't . we specifically put that in for , uh , the department of defense in the emergency room study , but we did not , uh , perform any cognitive , uh , impairment studies in this trial . 
{enum} michael higgins : okay , understood . um , in terms of efficacy at what point did you find the pain scores drop by {num} points? in {num} it was {num} minutes . but , how did it look here in {num}? 
{enum} pamela palmer : uh , it was a little bit longer than that . uh , we haven't gone through and calculated a lot of that data . um , this data's pretty fresh off the press . and--uh , but we absolutely will be reporting all of that . 
and just to back up on efficacy , you know , we calculate spids and prids and topars and all the different , uh , things , but really what it boils down to and what we wanted to give a kernel of , uh , that data today is the global assessments . i mean that's really taking all of the data and asking the patient , " hey , what did you think about this drug? how did it work for you? " and the fact that we had our highest patient global assessment and healthcare professional global assessment efficacy data that we've ever seen , i think really sums up the efficacy in general and it's just more meaningful than a spid{num} etc .

page 8 
{enum} michael higgins : yeah . no , overall the results are excellent . um , i noticed you didn't provide the drop in pain scores at {num} minutes . um , was there are drop that you can provide for us? 
{enum} pamela palmer : uh , actually right off the top of my head , i can't tell you exactly what it was at {num} minutes . we just gave you some ballpark estimate . all of this data will be presented in abstract and oral presentation form in upcoming meetings . 
{enum} michael higgins : okay . and then , one last one on efficacy , in the sap study {num} patients on {num} microgram dose took five doses at {num} hour dosing interval . in {num} they took {num} doses at a {num} hour interval . can you help us understand why there'd be a difference between the two? 
{enum} pamela palmer : yes , actually this was the first trial--i'm glad you asked that . this was the first trial where we allowed adjuvant analgesics to be more real world . uh , up until this point you know when you're trying to challenge yourself against beating placebo , the placebo response is very difficult to beat . surprisingly , {num} percent of patients will survive postoperatively with nothing but the placebo response . 
so , you really cannot cloud the waters with adjuvant analgesics , meaning you're also allowing non-steroidals or nerve block , etc . so , what we told our investigators was the patient still has to have greater than a four pain score , but you can use , you know , adjuvant analgesics , as you do in the real world . and so , i believe that's why we're seeing a little bit longer interdosing interval in this study compared to the sap{num} study . 
{enum} michael higgins : gotcha makes sense . um , and this is a safety study . so , uh , unintelligible real world , i suppose . 
{enum} howie rosen : mike , i was just going to add in terms of the range , and we'll have more data on this at some point , um , you know , there were patients that used update doses . so , um-- . 
{enum} michael higgins : --right . okay-- . 
{enum} howie rosen : --yeah , there still were , um , you know , patients at the longer end as well . 
{enum} michael higgins : okay . uh , and then , lastly , um , uh , any device errors , any human errors , any changes to the device since you started sap{num}? 
{enum} pamela palmer : uh , no , no . uh , the , uh , device is just very simple , very straightforward and it's not posing a problem for healthcare providers or patients . 
{enum} michael higgins : very good . thanks , guys . 
{enum} pamela palmer : sure .

page 9 
{enum} boris peaker : uh , good morning and congratulations on the progress . i guess , uh , my first question , uh , just curious have you had any discussions with the fda regarding drug liking or abuse potential studies or just in general abuse potential for this drug? 
{enum} pamela palmer : you know , in our work with , uh , the fda , they have not asked for specific studies relating to that . we are not--uh , the reason why is we're not trying to be an opioid , uh , or abuse diversion type of , uh , formulation . we are straightforward , immediate relief , used in the hospital only and we're a c{num} 
so , we're not looking to be at a lower , uh , classification in the scheduled drug standpoint . we're not trying to claim we're abuse deterrent or we're looking for that type of liability for our tablets . so , there really isn't anything about our product that we're looking for in the label . um , it's used in a medically-supervised setting in the place of iv liquid opioids . so , there's , um , really nothing to be learned from abuse liability studies . it will be a c2 drug . 
{enum} boris peaker : gotcha . okay . and so , i'm just curious also , uh , you mentioned the label . um , as you discuss , uh , the nda or you file the nda and you discus the filing with the fda on arx-{num} are there specific label attributes that you think is important to get into the label to really make this product to add significant commercial value to it , whether it'd be on the safety or the efficacy side? 
{enum} timothy morris : i think for the most part we're going to end up getting , um , class label . i mean , obviously , we'll--you know , we're looking for a relatively , uh , broader label with moderate to--um , treatment for moderate–to-severe pain , acute pain . um , we will be limited to administration by healthcare professionals , and we do believe that medically-supervised setting will be helpful . um , but in terms of anything specific for , um , safety or onset it's--um , we really expect it to be , uh , essentially a class label there for--um , for a c{num} 
{enum} boris peaker : gotcha . and my last question is so if you get approved for arx-{num} and then , you know , you restart this zalviso study in a few weeks and then file zalviso afterwards , would the zalviso filing be a new standalone nda or it'd really be just a supplementary nda because essentially it's the same product just formulated and have a different device? 
{enum} howie rosen : yeah , so , it's--this is howie . uh , so it would be a supplemental nda but actually off the original zalviso nda . 
{enum} timothy morris : six-month review . 
{enum} howie rosen : yeah , so--and it would be a six month review , um-- .

{enum} hugo ong : okay , great . and , gina , maybe you could remind us , uh , you know , in your market research about how many patients , uh , you know , coming through the hospital , including the er , um , you know , have renal and hepatic impairment that would make them good candidates for arx-{num} but not morphine? 
{enum} gina ford : you know , hugo , uh , thanks for the question . we've not segmented , um , either the market that low . we really are looking at the total market of moderate-to-severe acute pain patients that are , um , presenting to ers , uh , for trauma pain or those patients that are having surgery on an annual basis . so , we're not cutting the market at this point . 
{enum} hugo ong : okay , got it . all right , thanks , guys . 
operator : thank you . our next question comes from the line of ed arce with h . c . wainwright . please proceed with your question . 
{enum} ed arce : hi , again . thanks for taking the follow-up . uh , just wanted to ask about , um , the broader scope of your commercial opportunity . this is probably mostly for gina . uh , i know , uh , the primary target here is the er , and with {num} million moderate-to-severe patients annually , that's a big enough target already . but , i know you're looking at quite a few ancillary , um , uh , market opportunities , uh , for example , burn units , uh , interventional procedures , prisons , uh , ascs and the like . and i was thinking how--i was wondering if you could just , um , describe to us how you're thinking about , uh , approaching , uh , those varied markets . thanks . 
{enum} gina ford : sure , ed . thanks for the question . you know , the annual number of patients , um , that we're looking at that , uh , present to an emergency department with moderate-to-severe acute pain annually is {num} million . so , that is--um , that is a large market for us to consider . but , we're taking into consideration really , um , what our data points to , first and foremost of where arx-{num} will be , um , appropriate for treatment . so , yes , in our emergency room study we saw burns patients . we saw fracture patients . we saw sprains and strains , uh , dislocations . um , and then in our post surgical data , um , anything from abdominoplasty , um , which is extremely painful . um , in the last sap{num} study , we've seen some orthopedic procedures as well . 
so , looking purely at the data and our marketplace of hospital and post-op pain , um , you know , we have this very large market to approach . i think as we look further in the context of acelrx considering itself an opportunity within hospitals , we'll continue to look there for patients experiencing acute pain , um , in the burn units , um , in situations where , um , there's a very painful procedure that's performed in the hospital outpatient department . so , there are multiple ways for us to continue to look at this , um , market opportunity even really beyond sort of where we see our clinical data and those results , um , netting out .
